AB  - BACKGROUND: Community paramedicine programs (i.e., physician-directed preventive 
      care by emergency medical services personnel embedded in communities) offer a novel 
      approach to community-based health care. Project Swaddle, a community paramedicine 
      program for mothers and their infants, seeks to address (directly or through 
      referrals) the physical, mental, social, and economic needs of its participants. The 
      objective of this process evaluation was to describe women's experiences in Project 
      Swaddle. By understanding their experiences, our work begins to build the foundation 
      for similar programs and future examinations of the efficacy and effectiveness of 
      these approaches. METHODS: We completed 21 interviews with women living in Indiana 
      (July 2019-February 2020) who were currently participating in or had graduated from 
      Project Swaddle. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a 
      six-phase approach to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Program enrollment was influenced 
      by the community paramedics' experience and connections, as well as information 
      received in the community from related clinics or organizations. Participants viewed 
      the community paramedic as a trusted provider who supplied necessary health 
      information and support and served as their advocate. In their role as physician 
      extenders, the community paramedics enhanced patient care through monitoring 
      critical situations, facilitating communication with other providers, and supporting 
      routine healthcare. Women noted how community paramedics connected them to outside 
      resources (i.e., other experts, tangible goods), which aimed to support their 
      holistic health and wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate Project Swaddle 
      helped women connect with other healthcare providers, including increased access to 
      mental health services. The community paramedics were able to help women establish 
      care with primary care providers and pediatricians, then facilitate communication 
      with these providers. Women were supported through their early motherhood 
      experience, received education on parenting and taking control of their health, and 
      gained access to resources that met their diverse needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Betamethasone (BMZ) is used to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women 
      with threatened preterm birth, but its efficacy is variable and limited by the lack 
      of patient individualization in its dosing and administration. To determine sources 
      of variability and potential opportunities for individualization of therapy, the 
      objective of this study was to evaluate maternal factors associated with development 
      of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in a cohort of women who received 
      betamethasone. METHODS: This study prospectively enrolled women, gestational ages 
      23-34 weeks, who received betamethasone for threatened preterm birth. Maternal 
      demographics, prenatal history, and neonatal outcomes were abstracted from hospital 
      records. RDS was the primary outcome. Associations between RDS diagnosis and 
      maternal demographics, prenatal history, and betamethasone dosing were evaluated in 
      a case-control analysis and multivariable regression adjusted for gestational age at 
      delivery. Secondary analyses limited the cohort to women who delivered within 1 or 2 
      weeks of betamethasone dosing. RESULTS: Of 209 deliveries, 90 (43 %) resulted in 
      neonatal RDS. Within the overall cohort and controlling for gestational age at 
      birth, RDS was only associated with cesarean births compared to vaginal births 
      (adjusted OR 1.17 [1.06-1.29]). Route of delivery was also the only significant 
      factor related to RDS in the 83 neonates delivered within 7 days of BMZ dosing. 
      However, among 101 deliveries within 14 days of betamethasone dosing and controlling 
      for gestational age at birth, women who experienced preterm premature rupture of 
      membranes (PPROM) had lower RDS rates than those without PPROM (57.9 % vs. 80.2 %, 
      adjusted OR 0.81 [0.67-0.99]). Maternal age, BMI, race, and ethnicity were not 
      associated with RDS in the regression models. CONCLUSIONS: Of maternal 
      characteristics analyzed, only delivery by cesarean was associated with neonatal RDS 
      after antenatal betamethasone use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a 
      clinical intervention used to address alcohol and illicit drug use. SBIRT use has 
      resulted in positive health and social outcomes; however, SBIRT implementation 
      remains low. Research on implementing interventions, such as SBIRT, lacks 
      information about challenges and successes related to implementation. The Expert 
      Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) provides a framework to guide 
      comprehension, clarity, and relevance of strategies available for implementation 
      research. This framework was applied to qualitative feedback gathered from site 
      coordinators (SCs) leading SBIRT implementation. The purpose of this study was to 
      describe the SCs' experiences pertaining to SBIRT implementation across a health 
      system. METHODS: Within the context of a larger parent study, a semi-structured 
      interview guide was used to capture 14 SCs' perceptions of the barriers, 
      facilitators, and outcomes pertaining to SBIRT implementation. Qualitative data were 
      analyzed using standard content analytic procedures. A follow-up survey was 
      developed based on 14 strategies identified from qualitative data and was 
      administered electronically to determine the SC's perceptions of the most helpful 
      implementation strategies on a scale of 1 (least helpful) to 5 (most helpful). 
      RESULTS: All 14 invited SCs participated in the SBIRT implementation interview, and 
      11 of 14 (79%) responded to the follow-up survey. Within the categories of barriers, 
      facilitators, and outcomes, 25 subthemes emerged. The most helpful implementation 
      strategies were reexamining the implementation (M = 4.38; n = 8), providing ongoing 
      consultation (M = 4.13; n = 8), auditing and providing feedback (M = 4.1; n = 10), 
      developing education materials (M = 4.1; n = 10), identifying and preparing 
      champions (M = 4; n = 7), and tailoring strategies (M = 4; n = 7). CONCLUSION: SCs 
      who led implementation efforts within a large healthcare system identified several 
      barriers and facilitators to the implementation of SBIRT. Additionally, they 
      identified clinician-related outcomes associated with SBIRT implementation into 
      practice as well as strategies that were helpful in the implementation process. This 
      information can inform the implementation of SBIRT and other interventions in acute 
      care settings.

TI  - The Relationship Between Household Microfinance Group Participation and Vaccine 
      Adherence Among Children in Rural Western Kenya.
PG  - 1725-1734
LID - 10.1007/s10995-021-03217-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: High childhood vaccine adherence is critical for disease prevention, 
      and poverty is a key barrier to vaccine uptake. Interventions like microfinance 
      programs that aim to lift individuals out of poverty could thus improve vaccine 
      adherence of the children in the household. BIGPIC Family Program in rural Western 
      Kenya provides group-based microfinance services while working to improve access to 
      healthcare and health screenings for the local community. The aim of the present 
      paper is to evaluate the association between household participation in BIGPIC's 
      microfinance program and vaccine adherence among children in the household. We 
      hypothesize that microfinance group participation will have a positive impact on 
      vaccine adherence among children in the household. METHODS: From 2018 to 2019, we 
      surveyed a sample of 300 participants from two rural communities in Western Kenya, 
      some of whom were participants in the BIGPIC Family's microfinance program. The 
      primary outcome of interest was vaccine adherence of children in the household. 
      Log-binomial models were used to estimate the relationship between microfinance 
      group participation and vaccine adherence, adjusted for key covariates. We also 
      assessed whether the relationship differed by gender of the adult respondent. 
      RESULTS: Microfinance group members were more likely to have all children in their 
      households fully vaccinated [aPR (95% CI): 1.68 (1.20,2.35)] compared to 
      non-microfinance group members. Further, the association was stronger when women 
      were the microfinance members [PR (95% CI): 1.87 (1.27,2.76)] compared to men [PR 
      (95% CI): 1.24 (0.81,1.90)]. CONCLUSIONS: Microfinance participation was associated 
      with higher childhood vaccine adherence in rural Western Kenya. Microfinance 
      interventions should be further explored as strategies to improve child health and 
      well-being in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Background: Many women see an obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYN) annually and 
      receive their primary care from an OB/GYN. Understanding OB/GYNs' human 
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination practices, including knowledge of and barriers to 
      vaccination, is essential to design effective interventions to increase vaccination. 
      This study evaluated OB/GYN knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding vaccinating 
      both younger (18-26 years) and mid-adult (27-45 years) women. Materials and Methods: 
      Data were collected from OB/GYN providers in October 2019 through a nationwide 
      web-based survey. Items included the following: HPV-related vaccination practices, 
      recommendation strength, knowledge (seven items), benefits (four items), and 
      barriers (eight items). Results: The sample (n = 224) was majority were White (69%), 
      men (56%), and practice in suburban clinics (55%). Most (84%) reported they usually 
      or always recommend HPV vaccine to eligible patients, but estimated only about half 
      (51%) of other OB/GYNs did the same. Recommendation strength varied by patient age 
      with 84% strongly recommending it to patients ≤18 years, compared with 79% and 25% 
      strongly recommending to younger and mid-adult patients, respectively (p < 0.01). 
      Participants reported lower benefits (p = 0.007) and higher barriers (p < 0.001) for 
      27- to 45-year-old patients compared with younger patients. Cost was the most 
      frequently reported barrier, regardless of patient age. Overall knowledge was high 
      (m = 5.2/7) but 33% of participants did not know the vaccine was safe while 
      breastfeeding. Conclusions: Although providers reported strongly and consistently 
      recommending the HPV vaccination to their adult patients, there were gaps in 
      knowledge and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed. Provider performance 
      feedback may be important in improving HPV vaccination awareness among providers.

TI  - Financial hardship is associated with lower uptake of colorectal, breast, and 
      cervical cancer screenings.
PG  - 1173-1183

AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer screening uptake differs between groups in ways that cannot be 
      explained by socioeconomic status alone. This study examined associations between 
      material, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of financial hardship and cancer 
      screening behaviors. METHODS: Surveys were mailed to 7,979 people ages 18-75 who 
      were seen in the statewide health system in Indiana. Participants reported SES, 
      feelings about finances, and whether they had to forgo medical care due to cost. 
      This was compared to uptake of mammogram, colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, and Pap testing 
      in best-fit multivariable logistic regression analyses controlling for demographic 
      and healthcare characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 970 surveys were returned; the 
      majority of respondents were female (54%), non-Hispanic White (75%), and over 
      50 years old (76%). 15% reported forgoing medical care due to cost; this barrier was 
      higher among Black than White participants (24% vs. 13%; p = 0.001). In a best fit 
      regression model for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, those who reported they had to forgo 
      medical care due to cost had lower odds of screening (aOR 0.41; 95% CI 0.22-0.74). 
      Forgoing medical care due to cost was not significantly associated with Pap testing 
      in bivariate analyses. For mammogram, forgoing medical care due to cost was 
      significant in bivariate analyses (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.22-0.88), but was not 
      significant in the multivariable model. CONCLUSION: Associations between financial 
      hardship and cancer screening suggest the need to reduce barriers to cancer 
      screening even among patients who have access to healthcare. Future research should 
      explore barriers related to both healthcare and personal costs.

TI  - Influence of patient immigrant status on physician trainee diabetes treatment 
      decisions: a virtual patient experimental study.
PG  - 662-672
LID - 10.1007/s10865-021-00224-y [doi]
AB  - To determine the effect of patient immigrant status on physician trainees' diabetes 
      treatment decisions. Participants were 140 physician trainees ('providers'). 
      Providers viewed videos and vignettes of virtual patients differing in immigrant 
      status (born in Mexico or U.S.; other characteristics held constant). Analyses were 
      completed at the group and individual levels. Providers were less likely to refer 
      foreign-born (vs. U.S.-born) patients to endocrinology. Individual-level results 
      showed an almost even split between treatment ratings for foreign-born vs. U.S.-born 
      patients for three decisions (take no action, add oral hypoglycemic agent, 
      add/switch to insulin), explaining why group-level differences for these ratings did 
      not emerge (i.e., they were cancelled out). Physician trainees are less likely to 
      refer foreign-born patients to endocrinology. Half of individual-level decisions 
      were influenced by patient immigrant status, but group-level analyses mask these 
      differences. Systematic treatment differences based on non-relevant factors could 
      lead to adverse outcomes for immigrants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) is an important approach to patient-centered 
      care in women's reproductive healthcare. This study explored SDM experiences and 
      perceptions among non-physician healthcare professionals. METHODS: We completed 20 
      key-informant interviews with non-physician healthcare professionals (i.e., NP, RN, 
      CNM, doula, pharmacist, chiropractor) living in Indiana (September 2019-May 2020) 
      who provided community-based women's reproductive healthcare. Interviews were 
      audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an expanded grounded theory 
      framework. Constant comparative analysis identified emergent themes. RESULTS: 
      Professionals noted community-based healthcare required contextualized 
      decision-making approaches. Results identified listening, decisional ownership, and 
      engagement strategies that enhanced SDM involvement. Findings suggested 
      outcome-oriented SDM concepts, including decisional ownership and investigative 
      listening to enhance SDM. Providers redefined 'challenging' patients as engaged in 
      their healthcare and discussed ways SDM improved healthcare experience beyond one 
      visit. CONCLUSION: Findings offered insight into actionable and practical strategies 
      for enhancing SDM in community-based women's reproductive healthcare. The findings 
      offer strategies to improve SDM by addressing barriers and facilitators among 
      professionals. This extends SDM beyond the patient-physician dyad and supports 
      broader application of SDM. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Incorporating professionals' 
      experiences into SDM concepts can enhance SDM in community-based women's healthcare 
      practice, offering opportunities to support a culture of SDM across settings.

AB  - Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently a pandemic. Although pulmonary 
      health has been the primary focus of studies during the early days of COVID-19, 
      development of a comprehensive understanding of this emergent disease requires 
      knowledge of all possible disease manifestations in affected patients. This 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
      (PRISMA)-compliant review focuses on cutaneous manifestations reported in COVID-19 
      patients. Approach: Literature review was conducted using the PubMed database to 
      examine various cutaneous manifestations related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Published articles (n = 56) related to search criteria from the onset of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic to June 30, 2020, were included. The primary literature articles 
      included in this study were mainly from France, Spain, Italy, and the United 
      Kingdom. Results: Unique to many other symptoms of COVID-19, its cutaneous 
      manifestations have been found in people of all age groups, including children. The 
      cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are varied and include maculopapular, 
      chilblain-like, urticarial, vesicular, livedoid, and petechial lesions. In addition, 
      rashes are common in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a new and 
      serious health condition that shares symptoms with Kawasaki disease and is likely 
      related to COVID-19. In addition, personal protective equipment-related skin wounds 
      are of serious concern since broken cutaneous barriers can create an opening for 
      potential COVID-19 infections. Innovation and Conclusion: As this virus continues to 
      spread silently, mainly through asymptomatic carriers, an accurate and rapid 
      identification of these cutaneous manifestations may be vital to early diagnosis and 
      lead to possible better prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This systematic review and 
      photo atlas provide a detailed analysis of the skin pathologies related to COVID-19. 
      Study of these cutaneous manifestations and their pathogenesis, as well their 
      significance in human health will help define COVID-19 in its entirety, which is a 
      prerequisite to its effective management.

AB  - In Western Kenya, the burden of chronic wounds and lymphedema has a significant 
      impact on functionality and quality of life. Major barriers to provision of care 
      include availability, affordability, and accessibility of bandages. At the Academic 
      Model Providing Access to Healthcare, dermatologists and pharmacists collaborated to 
      develop a 2-component compression bandage modeled after the Unna boot, using locally 
      available materials, that is distributed through a revolving fund pharmacy network. 
      In partnership with nursing, use of these bandages at a national referral hospital 
      and a few county facilities has increased, but increasing utilization to an expanded 
      catchment area is needed.

TI  - Implementation of Infant Behavioral Sleep Intervention in a Diverse Sample of 
      Mothers.
PG  - 547-561

AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Behavioral Sleep Interventions (BSI) is an efficacious class 
      of treatment approaches for infant sleep disturbance. Little is known about BSI 
      implementation in the real world. Objectives were to a) examine the prevalence of 
      BSI implementation and related factors in a diverse sample of US mothers; b) assess 
      racial-ethnic group differences; and c) examine predictors of BSI implementation. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Participants included mothers (n= 353) with an infant (6-18 months) 
      from one of the three racial-ethnic groups: White Hispanic (n= 113), White 
      non-Hispanic (n= 122), Black non-Hispanic (n= 118). METHODS: Respondents completed 
      an online survey assessing BSI implementation, familiarity, barriers, sleep 
      knowledge, cognitions, and sleep patterns. RESULTS: Approximately one-third (36%) of 
      the sample endorsed BSI implementation and 59% reported BSI familiarity. Black 
      non-Hispanic mothers were more likely to report stopping a BSI prior to completion 
      (OR = 4.92, p <.05) and more likely to hear about BSI from a health-care 
      professional (OR = 1.32, p <.05) compared to White non-Hispanic mothers. 
      Racial-ethnic group differences were identified for a variety of sleep practices, 
      including bedsharing, independent sleep onset, and score on a validated measure of 
      problematic sleep. No racial-ethnic group differences were found in BSI 
      implementation, cognitions, or barriers. BSI implementation was predicted by BSI 
      familiarity, more maternal education, and cognitions around infant self-soothing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Differential BSI implementation does not appear to be a major driver of 
      sleep disparities, although Black non-Hispanic mothers who decide to implement BSI 
      do report notably lower completion rates. Future studies should examine alternative 
      mechanisms of sleep disparities as well as strategies to promote sleep health in 
      diverse families.

      States: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2018.

AB  - PURPOSE: Undiagnosed diabetes disproportionately affects medically underserved 
      groups. It is unknown whether being an immigrant confers additional risk for 
      undiagnosed diabetes. The purpose of this study was to examine independent 
      associations of immigrant status and race/ethnicity with the prevalence of diagnosed 
      and undiagnosed diabetes in a U.S.-based population sample. METHODS: Respondents 
      were 21,306 adults from the 2011-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
      Survey. Immigrant status was coded as foreign-born or U.S.-born. Six racial/ethnic 
      categories were white, Black, Mexican American, other Hispanic, Asian, and 
      other/multiracial. Self-report and laboratory data yielded a three-level diabetes 
      status outcome: no diabetes (88%), diagnosed diabetes (10%), and undiagnosed 
      diabetes (2%). RESULTS: Adjusted multinomial logistic regression models evaluating 
      immigrant status and race/ethnicity as simultaneous predictors revealed that 
      foreign-born (vs. U.S.-born) adults had a similar prevalence of diagnosed diabetes 
      (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.79-1.22, P = .84) but a higher prevalence of undiagnosed 
      diabetes (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.21-1.97, P = .004). Models showed that all 
      racial/ethnic minority groups except the other/multiracial group (vs. whites) had a 
      higher prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes (Ps < .04). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Immigrants and racial/ethnic minority adults have increased odds of undiagnosed 
      diabetes, even after accounting for health insurance. These groups are likely at 
      increased risk for diabetes complications because of prolonged periods of undetected 
      diabetes.

TI  - Association of State Medicaid Expansion With Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Liver 
      Transplant Wait-listing in the United States.
PG  - e2019869

LID - e2019869
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Millions of Americans gained insurance through the state expansion of 
      Medicaid, but several states with large populations of racial/ethnic minorities did 
      not expand their programs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the implications of Medicaid 
      expansion for liver transplant (LT) wait-listing trends for racial/ethnic 
      minorities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cohort study was performed of 
      adults wait-listed for LT using the United Network of Organ Sharing database between 
      January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017. Poisson regression and a controlled, 
      interrupted time series analysis were used to model trends in wait-listing rates by 
      race/ethnicity. The setting was LT centers in the United States. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: (1) Wait-listing rates by race/ethnicity in states that expanded Medicaid 
      (expansion states) compared with those that did not (nonexpansion states) and (2) 
      actual vs predicted rates of LT wait-listing by race/ethnicity after Medicaid 
      expansion. RESULTS: There were 75 748 patients (median age, 57.0 [interquartile 
      range, 50.0-62.0] years; 48 566 [64.1%] male) wait-listed for LT during the study 
      period. The cohort was 8.9% Black and 16.4% Hispanic. Black patients and Hispanic 
      patients were statistically significantly more likely to be wait-listed in expansion 
      states than in nonexpansion states (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.54 [95% CI, 
      1.44-1.64] for Black patients and 1.21 [95% CI, 1.15-1.28] for Hispanic patients). 
      After Medicaid expansion, there was a decrease in the wait-listing rate of Black 
      patients in expansion states (annual percentage change [APC], -4.4%; 95% CI, -8.2% 
      to -0.6%) but not in nonexpansion states (APC, 0.5%; 95% CI, -4.0% to 5.2%). This 
      decrease was not seen when Black patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) were excluded 
      from the analysis (APC, 3.1%; 95% CI, -2.4% to 8.9%), suggesting that they may be 
      responsible for this expansion state trend. Hispanic Medicaid patients without HCV 
      were statistically significantly more likely to be wait-listed in the post-Medicaid 
      expansion era than would have been predicted without Medicaid expansion (APC, 13.2%; 
      95% CI, 4.0%-23.2%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that LT 
      wait-listing rates have decreased for Black patients with HCV in states that 
      expanded Medicaid. Conversely, wait-listing rates have increased for Hispanic 
      patients without HCV. Black patients and Hispanic patients may have benefited 
      differently from Medicaid expansion.

TI  - The relationship between a microfinance-based healthcare delivery platform, health 
      insurance coverage, health screenings, and disease management in rural Western

AB  - BACKGROUND: Structural barriers often prevent rural Kenyans from receiving 
      healthcare and diagnostic testing. The Bridging Income Generation through grouP 
      Integrated Care (BIGPIC) Family intervention facilitates microfinance groups, 
      provides health screenings and treatment, and delivers education about health 
      insurance coverage to address some of these barriers. This study evaluated the 
      association between participation in BIGPIC microfinance groups and health 
      screening/disease management outcomes. METHODS: From November 2018 to March 2019, we 
      interviewed a sample of 300 members of two rural communities in Western Kenya, 100 
      of whom were BIGPIC microfinance members. We queried participants about their 
      experiences with health screening and disease management for HIV, diabetes, 
      hypertension, tuberculosis, and cervical cancer. We used log-binomial regression 
      models to estimate the association between microfinance membership and each health 
      outcome, adjusting for key covariates. RESULTS: Microfinance members were more 
      likely to be screened for most of the health conditions we queried, including those 
      provided by BIGPIC [e.g. diabetes: aPR (95% CI): 3.46 (2.60, 4.60)] and those not 
      provided [e.g. cervical cancer: aPR (95% CI): 2.43 (1.21, 4.86)]. Microfinance 
      membership was not significantly associated with health insurance uptake and disease 
      management outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In rural Kenya, a microfinance program integrated 
      with healthcare delivery may be effective at increasing health screening. 
      Interventions designed to thoughtfully and sustainably address structural barriers 
      to healthcare will be critical to improving the health of those living in 
      low-resource settings.

AB  - Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, often negatively affect the economic 
      wellbeing of affected individuals. Under such conditions, women may engage in 
      transactional sexual behaviors in order to compensate for lost income and provide 
      for their households. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between hurricane 
      impact and transactional sex and if this relationship was moderated, or mediated, 
      through economic factors. Between December 2017 and February 2018, approximately one 
      year after the area was hit by a category 4 hurricane (Hurricane Matthew), we 
      interviewed a random sample of female microfinance members (n = 304) in Okay, Haiti. 
      We estimated the association between hurricane impact and transactional sex using 
      log-binomial regression. Next, we tested for economic moderation of this 
      relationship by incorporating interaction terms between hurricane impact and food 
      insecurity, poverty, and loss of income generating materials in three separate 
      log-binomial models. Finally, we assessed possible mediation of this relationship by 
      loss of income generating resources and a latent variable, economic stress, using a 
      structural equation model. We found participants who had experienced hurricane 
      impact were 58% more likely to have engaged in transactional sex [prevalence ratio 
      (95% confidence interval): 1.58 (1.19-2.09)]. This relationship was significant and 
      strongly positive among women who were food insecure and had high poverty but not so 
      among women who were food secure and had low poverty, respectively. The final 
      structural equation model (with fit: χ(2) = 19.700, degrees of freedom = 15; 
      CFI = 0.958; TLI = 0.941; RMSEA = 0.040) revealed that the relationship was not 
      mediated through economic factors. However, the association between hurricane impact 
      and transactional sex remained significant while controlling for these economic 
      factors. Notably, the findings that the relationship between hurricane impact and 
      transactional sex was moderated, but not mediated, by economic factors implies 
      populations at-risk of experiencing natural disasters should be preemptively 
      targeted with economic interventions to build capacity and resilience before such a 
      disaster hits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medicare Part D medication therapy management (MTM) includes an annual 
      comprehensive medication review (CMR) as a strategy to mitigate suboptimal 
      medication use in older adults. OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics of 
      Medicare beneficiaries who were eligible, offered, and received a CMR in 2013 and 
      2014 and identify potential disparities. METHODS: This nationally representative 
      cross-sectional study used a 20% random sample of Medicare Part A, B, and D data 
      linked with Part D MTM files. A total of 5,487,343 and 5,822,188 continuously 
      enrolled beneficiaries were included in 2013 and 2014, respectively. CMR use was 
      examined among a subset of 620,164 and 669,254 of these beneficiaries enrolled in 
      the MTM program in 2013 and 2014. Main measures were MTM eligibility, CMR offer, and 
      CMR receipt. The Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use informed 
      covariates selected. RESULTS: In 2013 and 2014, 505,658 (82%) and 649,201 (97%) MTM 
      eligible beneficiaries were offered a CMR, respectively. Among those, CMR receipt 
      increased from 81,089 (16%) in 2013 to 119,181 (18%) in 2014. The mean age of CMR 
      recipients was 75 years (±7) and the majority were women, White, and without 
      low-income status. In 2014, lower odds of CMR receipt were associated with 
      increasing age (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.99 (95% confidence interval 
      (CI) = 0.994-0.995), male sex (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.926-0.951), being any non-White 
      race/ethnicity except Black, dual-Medicaid status (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.626-0.650), 
      having a hospitalization (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.839-0.893) or emergency department 
      visit (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.658-0.686), and number of comorbidities (OR = 0.90, 95% 
      CI = 0.896-0.905). CONCLUSIONS: CMR offers and completion rates have increased, but 
      disparities in CMR receipt by age, sex, race, and dual-Medicaid status were evident. 
      Changes to MTM targeting criteria and CMR offer strategies may be warranted to 
      address disparities.

TI  - Cross-Sectional Association between Behaviors Related to Sugar-Containing Foods and 
      Dental Outcomes among Hispanic Immigrants.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17145095 [doi]
LID - 5095
AB  - A cross-sectional, self-administered survey was used to gather information about 
      dental outcomes, sugar-containing food behaviors and intake, and sociodemographic 
      characteristics of adults of Mexican and Central-American (Guatemala, El Salvador, 
      Honduras) origin (n = 517). Bivariate and multiple-variable logistic regressions 
      were used to examine the associations of behaviors related to added sugar-containing 
      foods/beverages (overall intake and consumption before bed) with dental outcomes. 
      Outcome measures involved dental outcomes, dental self-care practices, and added 
      sugar intake. Estimated daily added sugar intake among all participants was 98 (SD = 
      99) g, with no difference in consumption among participants from different 
      countries. The majority of added sugar (63 (SD = 74) g) was provided by 
      sugar-sweetened beverages. Participants who reported consuming sugar-containing 
      foods or beverages within an hour before bed were more likely to report having a 
      fair/poor/very poor condition of teeth and gums and having felt dental pain (p < 
      0.05 for all). The amount of sugar intake was associated with being prescribed 
      medication for oral or dental problems (p = 0.008) and dental pain (p = 0.003). 
      Findings support the association between sugar containing food-related behaviors and 
      dental problems among Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. Health promotion and 
      preventive interventions for this population should consider these behaviors as 
      modifiable contributors to adverse dental outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Periconceptional diet quality is commonly suboptimal and 
      sociodemographic disparities in diet quality exist. However, it is unknown whether 
      individual periconceptional diet quality is associated with obstetric outcomes. 
      OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes 
      according to maternal periconceptional diet quality. STUDY DESIGN: This is a 
      secondary analysis of a large, multicenter prospective cohort study of 10,038 
      nulliparous women receiving obstetrical care at 8 United States centers. Women 
      underwent 3 antenatal study visits and had detailed maternal and neonatal data 
      abstracted by trained research personnel. In the first trimester (between 6 and 13 
      weeks), women completed the modified Block 2005 Food Frequency Questionnaire, a 
      semiquantitative assessment of usual dietary intake for the 3 months around 
      conception. Responses were scored using the Healthy Eating Index-2010, which 
      assesses adherence to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Higher scores on 
      the Healthy Eating Index represent better adherence. Healthy Eating Index scores 
      were analyzed by quartile; quartile 4 represents the highest dietary quality. 
      Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess associations between 
      diet quality and outcomes. A sensitivity analysis in which markers of socioeconomic 
      status were included in the multivariable Poisson regression models was performed. 
      RESULTS: In the cohort of 8259 women with Healthy Eating Index data, the mean 
      Healthy Eating Index score was 63 (±13) of 100. Women with the lowest quartile 
      Healthy Eating Index scores were more likely to be younger, non-Hispanic black and 
      Hispanic, publicly insured, low income, and tobacco users. They were more likely to 
      have comorbidities (obesity, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, mental 
      health disorders), a higher prepregnancy body mass index, and less education. Women 
      with lowest quartile scores experienced less frequent major perineal lacerations and 
      more frequent postpartum hemorrhage requiring transfusion and hypertensive disorders 
      of pregnancy, which persisted on multivariable analyses (controlling for age, body 
      mass index, tobacco use, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes mellitus, and 
      mental health disorders) comparing women in each quartile with quartile 4. 
      Additionally, women in quartiles 1 and 2 experienced greater adjusted relative risk 
      of cesarean delivery compared with women in quartile 4. Neonatal outcomes also 
      differed by dietary quartile, with women in the lowest Healthy Eating Index quartile 
      experiencing greater adjusted relative risk of preterm birth, neonatal intensive 
      care unit admission, small for gestational age infant, and low birthweight, and 
      lower risk of macrosomia; all neonatal findings also persisted in multivariable 
      analyses. The sensitivity analysis with inclusion of markers of socioeconomic status 
      (race/ethnicity, insurance status, marital status) in the multivariable models 
      supported these findings. CONCLUSION: Periconceptional diet quality among women in 
      the United States is poor. Poorer periconceptional dietary quality is associated 
      with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, even after controlling for potential 
      comorbidities and body mass index, suggesting periconceptional diet may be an 
      important social or biological determinant of health underlying existing health 
      disparities.

TI  - Communicating Cervical Cancer Screening Results in Light of New Guidelines: Clinical 
      Practices at Federally Qualified Health Centers.

AB  - New guidelines for cervical cancer screening (CCS) incorporate both HPV and Pap 
      tests, and there is a need to understand communication of these cotesting results to 
      patients, especially in at-risk populations disproportionally affected by cervical 
      cancer. This study used computer-assisted telephone interviews in 2017 at 51 
      federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in Indiana to evaluate the 
      characteristics of clinical communication CCS results to women. Results revealed 
      that clinical communication practices varied on channel, timing, and content. Almost 
      half of the clinics (n = 23, 45%) communicate results to patients by phone. Most 
      clinics (n = 47, 92%) notify patients of results in two weeks or less. For 
      cotesting, 70% (n = 36) always communicate Pap/HPV results at the same time. The 
      majority of clinics (n = 42, 82%) explain the type of abnormal Pap test, while only 
      43% (n = 22) discuss the cervical cancer risk as indicated by the HPV test result. 
      Even though 98% (n = 48) of participants rated their communication strategy as 
      effective, qualitatively participants acknowledged difficulties in communicating 
      cotesting results with their often transient and low health literate patients 
      populations. These results indicate considerable variation and potential deficits in 
      clinical communication of cotesting results in FQHCs, but several promising 
      communication strategies were identified that may inform improved screening 
      communication for other clinics.

TI  - "A problem shared is half solved" - a qualitative assessment of barriers and 
      facilitators to adolescent retention in HIV care in western Kenya.
PG  - 104-112
LID - 10.1080/09540121.2019.1668530 [doi]
AB  - Adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV, ages 10-19) are retained in care at low rates, 
      resulting in poor clinical outcomes. We investigated barriers and facilitators to 
      retention experienced by perinatally infected ALHIV in western Kenya. This 
      qualitative study purposefully sampled hospitalized ALHIV (engaged and not currently 
      engaged in care), ALHIV engaged in outpatient care, and caregivers of ALHIV. In 
      total, 116 ALHIV and caregivers participated in interviews or focus group 
      discussions. Challenges related to the effects of both stigma and poverty at 
      multiple socio-ecological levels pose the greatest barriers to adolescent retention 
      in HIV care. Adolescents with positive relationships with family, clinic, and/or 
      peers with the resources to support their care are facilitated to overcome these 
      barriers. Conversely, adolescents with few of these supports due to orphanhood, 
      caregiver illness, severe poverty, family conflicts, negative relationships with 
      healthcare workers, or isolation, have the greatest challenges staying in care, and 
      maybe at risk of disengagement. Experiences of trauma emerged from narratives of 
      disengagement, and contribute to isolation, mental health challenges, and 
      difficulties engaging in care. Retention of the most vulnerable adolescents will 
      require interventions to mitigate the impacts of stigma, poverty, mental health 
      issues, and limited social support on HIV care engagement.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess caregiver comfort regarding 
      adolescent completion of computerized health screening questionnaires created for 
      adolescents. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-method, cross-sectional survey of 
      caregivers of adolescent patients (n = 104) aged 12-18 years who had a medical visit 
      between June 2017 and August 2017. Topics assessed included who completed the 
      questionnaire, caregiver comfort and concern regarding questionnaire data, and 
      caregiver reasons for involvement in completing the questionnaire. A one-way 
      analysis of variance was used to compare the age of the adolescent and caregiver 
      involvement in the questionnaire. RESULTS: The majority of adolescents (64%) 
      reported independent completion of the questionnaire. Thirteen percent of caregivers 
      completed the questionnaire with no involvement of the adolescent and 23% reported 
      that caregivers and adolescents completed the questionnaire in tandem. The majority 
      of caregivers (84%) were comfortable with adolescents completing the questionnaire. 
      A variety of reasons were identified for caregivers completing the questionnaire 
      (time constraints, 22%; adolescent requested caregiver help, 19%; caregiver desired 
      to answer questions, 14%; caregiver did not realize that the questionnaire was 
      intended for the adolescent, 11%; caregiver believed that the adolescent was too 
      young to respond alone, 11%). Caregiver comfort with adolescent completing the 
      questionnaire increase with age. CONCLUSION: We found the reason most caregivers 
      gave for completing the questionnaires were related to clinic processes (e.g. time 
      constraints). Caregivers were more likely to complete the questionnaire with younger 
      adolescents. Thus, pediatricians should consider how to best prepare families for 
      initial questionnaires in primary care.

TI  - Black Adult Patients With Acute Liver Failure Are Sicker and More Likely to Undergo 
      Liver Transplantation Than White Patients.
PG  - 1634-1641

AB  - Racial and ethnic differences in the presentation and outcomes of patients 
      wait-listed with acute liver failure (ALF) have not been explored. Adult patients 
      with ALF wait-listed for liver transplantation (LT) from 2002 to 2016 were 
      investigated using the United Network for Organ Sharing database. Clinical 
      characteristics and causative etiologies were compared between white, black, 
      Hispanic, and Asian patients with ALF who were wait-listed as status 1. A competing 
      risk analysis was used to explore differences in LT and wait-list removal rates. 
      Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to explore differences in 1-year 
      posttransplant survival. There were 8208 patients wait-listed with a primary 
      diagnosis of ALF; 4501 were wait-listed as status 1 (55.3% of whites, 64.4% of 
      blacks, 51.6% of Hispanics, 40.7% of Asians; P < 0.001). Black patients had higher 
      bilirubin and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease at wait-listing than other groups. 
      White patients were the most likely to have acetaminophen toxicity as a causative 
      etiology, whereas black patients were the most likely to have autoimmune liver 
      disease. Black patients were significantly more likely to undergo LT than white 
      patients (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.30). There was no 
      difference in wait-list removal because of death or clinical deterioration among 
      racial/ethnic groups. The 1-year posttransplant survival was lowest in black 
      patients (79.6%) versus white (82.8%), Hispanic (83.9%), and Asian (89.3%) patients 
      (P = 0.02). In conclusion, etiologies of ALF vary by race and ethnicity. Black 
      patients with ALF were more likely to be wait-listed as status 1 and undergo LT than 
      white patients, but they were sicker at presentation. The 1-year posttransplant 
      survival rate was lowest among black patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes the impact of various levels of participation in a 
      nurse-led coalition-based wellness program on participant outcomes related to body 
      mass index, blood pressure, diabetes risk, and lifestyle behaviors in a Midwest 
      rural county. DESIGN: This descriptive study used de-identified data collected by 
      program staff over a 26-month period to evaluate participant outcomes. SAMPLE: 
      Participants were predominantly female with a mean age of 49 years; 41% identified 
      as Hispanic. MEASUREMENTS/ANALYSIS: Lifestyle behavior surveys and biometric 
      screenings were used to collect data. Latent Growth Class Analysis and logistic 
      regression were used to analyze the data. INTERVENTION: Monthly wellness programming 
      including screenings, health education and referrals were provided to participants 
      at various sites in a rural community. RESULTS: Over a 26-month period, 3,004 visits 
      were made by 820 participants. Four clusters for participants (n = 287) who had made 
      three visits or more were identified, providing insight into meaningful 
      interindividual differences for repeat participants. Overall, repeat participants 
      either maintained or improved their blood pressure over time. Indirect outcomes 
      including policy, system, and environmental changes were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Coalitions can positively affect the health of populations through these types of 
      programs at the individual and population level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa continues to face the highest rate of mortality from 
      diabetes in the world due to limited access to quality diabetes care. We assessed 
      the quality of diabetes care in a rural diabetes clinic in western Kenya. METHODS: 
      To provide a comprehensive assessment, a set of clinical outcomes, process, and 
      structure metrics were evaluated to assess the quality of diabetes care provided in 
      the outpatient clinic at Webuye District Hospital. The primary clinical outcome 
      measures were the change in HbA1c and point of care blood glucose. In assessing 
      process metrics, the primary measure was the percentage of patients who were lost to 
      follow up. The structure metrics were assessed by evaluating different facets of the 
      operation of the clinic and their accordance with the International Diabetes 
      Federation (IDF) guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 524 patients were enrolled into the 
      diabetes clinic during the predefined period of evaluation. The overall clinic 
      population demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c and point of 
      care blood glucose at all time points of evaluation after baseline. Patients had a 
      mean baseline HbA1C of 10.2% which decreased to 8.4% amongst the patients who 
      remained in care after 18 months. In terms of process measures, 38 patients (7.3%) 
      were characterized as being lost to follow up as they missed clinic visits for more 
      than 6 months. Through the assessment of structural metrics, the clinic met at least 
      the minimal standards of care for 14 out of the 19 domains recommended by the IDF. 
      CONCLUSION: This analysis illustrates the gains made in various elements of diabetes 
      care quality which can be used by other programs to guide diabetes care scale up 
      across the region.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality are higher in black vs 
      white populations. The reasons for these disparities are not clear, yet some 
      guidelines recommend screening black persons for colorectal cancer starting at 40-45 
      years of age. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the 
      prevalence of advanced adenomas (AAs) and advanced precancerous colorectal neoplasms 
      (ACNs) between asymptomatic black and white screen-eligible adults. METHODS: We 
      searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify articles 
      (published from 1946 through June 2017) that reported prevalence values of AA or ACN 
      in average-risk black and white individuals undergoing screening colonoscopy. Two 
      authors independently assessed study quality and risk for bias using a modified 
      validated quality assessment instrument. In accord with the Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 2 authors 
      independently abstracted descriptive and quantitative data from each study. We 
      performed a random-effects meta-analysis to determine risk differences and odds 
      ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Of 1653 articles, we identified 9 studies for analysis that 
      included 302,128 individuals. Six of the 9 studies were of high methodologic 
      quality, and had a low risk for bias. In these 9 studies, the overall prevalence 
      values for AA and ACN did not differ significantly between black (6.57%) and white 
      (6.20%) screened individuals (OR 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-1.30). In a 
      subgroup of 5 studies, the prevalence of proximal AA and ACN was significantly 
      higher in black (3.30%) than in white (2.42%) screened individuals (OR 1.20; 95% CI 
      1.12-1.30). Excluding the largest study did not affect overall prevalence (OR 0.99; 
      CI 0.73-1.34) but did eliminate the difference in prevalence of proximal AA or ACN 
      (OR 1.48; 95% CI 0.87-2.52). CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, we found the 
      overall prevalence of AA and ACN did not differ significantly between average-risk 
      black and white persons, indicating that the age at which to begin colorectal cancer 
      screening need not differ based on race alone.

TI  - Prevalence and treatment of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder among 
      trauma patients with non-neurological injuries.
PG  - 999-1006
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000001992 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological impairment among injury survivors is well documented. 
      Little is known about the prevalence of treatment of psychological impairment, 
      however. We aimed to determine the proportion of injury survivors treated for 
      depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the year after injury as well 
      as to determine potential barriers to treatment. METHODS: Adults (18 and older) 
      admitted to a Level I trauma center with an injury severity score greater than 10 
      but without traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury were eligible for study 
      inclusion. The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression and PTSD 
      CheckList-Civilian Versions surveys were administered during the initial 
      hospitalization and repeated at 1, 2, 4, and 12 months after injury. Patients were 
      asked if they received treatment specifically for depression or PTSD at each 
      follow-up. Factors associated with treatment were determined using multivariable 
      logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Five hundred injury survivors were enrolled 
      in this prospective observational study. Of those, 68.4% of patients screened 
      positive for depression at some point in the year after their injury (53.3%, 1 
      month; 49.9%, 2 months; 49.0%, 4 months; and 50.2%, 12 months). Only 22.2% of 
      depressed patients reported receiving treatment for depression; 44.4% of patients 
      screened positive for PTSD (26.6%, 1 month; 27.8%, 2 months; 29.8%, 4 months; and 
      30.0%, 12 months), but only 9.8% received treatment for PTSD. After adjusting for 
      other factors, compared to commercial insurance status, self-pay insurance status 
      was negatively associated with treatment for PTSD or depression (odds ratio, 0.44; 
      95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.95). CONCLUSION: Depression and PTSD are common in 
      non-neurotrauma patients in the year following injury. Greater collaboration between 
      those caring for injury survivors and behavioral health experts may help improve 
      psychological outcomes after injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/Care management, 
      level IV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While naloxone, the overdose reversal medication, has been available for 
      decades, factors associated with its availability through pharmacies remain unclear. 
      Studies suggest that policy and pharmacist beliefs may impact availability. Indiana 
      passed a standing order law for naloxone in 2015 to increase access to naloxone. 
      OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with community pharmacy naloxone stocking 
      and dispensing following the enactment of a statewide naloxone standing order. 
      METHODS: A 2016 cross-sectional census of Indiana community pharmacists was 
      conducted following a naloxone standing order. Community, pharmacy, and pharmacist 
      characteristics, and pharmacist attitudes about naloxone dispensing, access, and 
      perceptions of the standing order were measured. Modified Poisson and binary 
      logistic regression models attempted to predict naloxone stocking and dispensing, 
      respectively. RESULTS: Over half (58.1%) of pharmacies stocked naloxone, yet 23.6% 
      of pharmacists dispensed it. Most (72.5%) pharmacists believed the standing order 
      would increase naloxone stocking, and 66.5% believed it would increase dispensing. 
      Chain pharmacies were 3.2 times as likely to stock naloxone. Naloxone stocking was 
      1.6 times as likely in pharmacies with more than one full-time pharmacist. 
      Pharmacies where pharmacists received naloxone continuing education in the past two 
      years were 1.3 times as likely to stock naloxone. The attempted dispensing model 
      yielded no improvement over the constant-only model. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacies with 
      larger capacity took advantage of the naloxone standing order. Predictors of 
      pharmacist naloxone dispensing should continue to be explored to maximize naloxone 
      access.

TI  - "Does this Look Infected to You?" Social Network Predictors of Dental Help-Seeking 
      Among Mexican Immigrants.
PG  - 399-409
LID - 10.1007/s10903-017-0572-x [doi]
AB  - Compared to U.S. born Latinos, Mexican immigrants (MAs) have diminished health care 
      access and face substantial barriers to accessing needed dental health services. 
      However, little research has examined how MAs social networks shape their use of 
      dental health services. Using data from 332 Mexican immigrants to the Midwest, this 
      research examines the significance of individual and egocentric network 
      characteristics on two measures of dental health service utilization. Findings 
      reveal that network size, network dental service utilization, and the frequency with 
      which MAs discuss acute problems with network ties, positively correspond to use of 
      oral health services. Conversely, embeddedness in networks where ties hassle egos 
      about dental issues and have low levels of dental health knowledge correspond to 
      lower odds of using these services. This research is among the first to use ego 
      network data and methods to examine the ways network characteristics shape oral 
      health behaviors among this underserved population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mexican immigrants in the United States suffer from poor oral health. 
      The objective of the current study was to explore the utility of applying 
      theory-based factors associated with seeking preventive dental care in a sample of 
      Mexican American adults. METHODS: Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey 
      of a sample of 157 people of Mexican origin (64% female; age 34 ± 11 years) 
      recruited primarily from church congregations and lay community organizations in 
      Central Indiana. Using the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction as the guiding 
      framework, structural equation modeling was used to test factors associated with 
      intention to seek preventive dental care. RESULTS: Attitude towards seeking 
      preventive dental care (estimate = 0.37; p < .0001) and self-efficacy for seeking 
      preventive dental care (estimate = 0.68; p < .0001) were associated with intention 
      to seek preventive dental care. The association between dental beliefs and intention 
      to seek preventive dental care was mediated by attitude and self-efficacy (indirect 
      effect = 0.26, p = .002), and the association between past behavior and intention to 
      seek preventive dental care was mediated by self-efficacy (indirect effect = 0.26, 
      p = .003). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that interventions to increase 
      preventive dental care seeking behavior among Mexican Americans should focus on 
      changing attitudes toward seeking preventive dental care and on increasing 
      self-efficacy to seek preventive dental care. Findings also support the use of 
      interventions to influence dental beliefs.

TI  - Preliminary efficacy of service dogs as a complementary treatment for posttraumatic 
      stress disorder in military members and veterans.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Psychiatric service dogs are an emerging complementary treatment for 
      military members and veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Yet despite 
      anecdotal accounts of their value, there is a lack of empirical research on their 
      efficacy. The current proof-of-concept study assessed the effects of this practice. 
      METHOD: A nonrandomized efficacy trial was conducted with 141 post-9/11 military 
      members and veterans with PTSD to compare usual care alone (n = 66) with usual care 
      plus a trained service dog (n = 75). The primary outcome was longitudinal change on 
      The PTSD Checklist (PCL; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993), including 
      data points from a cross-sectional assessment and a longitudinal record review. 
      Secondary outcomes included cross-sectional differences in depression, quality of 
      life, and social and work functioning. RESULTS: Mixed-model analyses revealed 
      clinically significant reductions in PTSD symptoms from baseline following the 
      receipt of a service dog, but not while receiving usual care alone. Though 
      clinically meaningful, average reductions were not below the diagnostic cutoff on 
      the PCL. Regression analyses revealed significant differences with medium to large 
      effect sizes among those with service dogs compared with those on the waitlist, 
      including lower depression, higher quality of life, and higher social functioning. 
      There were no differences in employment status, but there was lower absenteeism 
      because of health among those who were employed. CONCLUSION: The addition of trained 
      service dogs to usual care may confer clinically meaningful improvements in PTSD 
      symptomology for military members and veterans with PTSD, though it does not appear 
      to be associated with a loss of diagnosis. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - Since access to HIV testing, counselling, and drug therapy has improved so 
      dramatically, scholars have investigated ways this 'scale-up' has interacted with 
      HIV/AIDS-related stigma in sub-Saharan Africa. Drawing on data collected during 
      ethnographic research in a trading centre in western Kenya, this paper critically 
      analyses two violent and localised case studies of panic over the ill health of 
      particular community residents as a nuanced lens through which to explore the 
      dynamic interplay of gender politics and processes of HIV/AIDS-related stigma in the 
      aftershocks of the AIDS crisis. Gaining theoretical momentum from literatures 
      focusing on stigma, gender, witchcraft, gossip, and accusation, we argue that the 
      cases highlight collective anxieties, as well as local critiques of shifting gender 
      roles and the strain of globalisation and legacies of uneven development on myriad 
      forms of relationships. We further contend that these heightened moments of panic 
      and accusation were deployments of power that ultimately sharpened local gender 
      politics and conflicts on the ground in ways that complicated the social solidarity 
      necessary to tackle social and health inequalities. The paper highlights one 
      community's challenge to eradicate the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS during a 
      period of increased access to HIV services.

AB  - This article describes the development of a 6-week multiple caregiver group 
      intervention for primary caregivers of adolescents diagnosed with Oppositional 
      Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder in low-income African American families. The 
      intervention is aimed at increasing the primary caregivers' self-efficacy in 
      managing interactions within the family and especially with child serving 
      educational, mental health, juvenile justice, and child welfare systems. Development 
      of the intervention involved seven iterative activities performed in a collaborative 
      effort between an interdisciplinary academic team, community engagement specialists, 
      members of the targeted population, and clinical partners from a large public mental 
      health system. The intervention development process described in this article can 
      provide guidance for teams that aim to develop new mental health interventions that 
      target specific outcomes in populations with unique needs.

TI  - Trends in Characteristics of Patients Listed for Liver Transplantation Will Lead to 
      Higher Rates of Waitlist Removal Due to Clinical Deterioration.
PG  - 2368-2374
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000001851 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes in the epidemiology of end-stage liver disease may lead to 
      increased risk of dropout from the liver transplant waitlist. Anticipating the 
      future of liver transplant waitlist characteristics is vital when considering organ 
      allocation policy. METHODS: We performed a discrete event simulation to forecast 
      patient characteristics and rate of waitlist dropout. Estimates were simulated from 
      2015 to 2025. The model was informed by data from the Organ Procurement and 
      Transplant Network, 2003 to 2014. National data are estimated along with forecasts 
      for 2 regions. RESULTS: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis will increase from 18% of 
      waitlist additions to 22% by 2025. Hepatitis C will fall from 30% to 21%. Listings 
      over age 60 years will increase from 36% to 48%. The hazard of dropout will increase 
      from 41% to 46% nationally. Wait times for transplant for patients listed with a 
      Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) between 22 and 27 will double. Region 5, 
      which transplants at relatively higher MELD scores, will experience an increase from 
      53% to 64% waitlist dropout. Region 11, which transplants at lower MELD scores, will 
      have an increase in waitlist dropout from 30% to 44%. CONCLUSIONS: The liver 
      transplant waitlist size will remain static over the next decade due to patient 
      dropout. Liver transplant candidates will be older, more likely to have nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis and will wait for transplantation longer even when listed at a 
      competitive MELD score. There will continue to be significant heterogeneity among 
      transplant regions where some patients will be more likely to drop out of the 
      waitlist than receive a transplant.

TI  - Use of Internet for General and Dental Health along Acculturation Features in a 
      Sample of Mexican Americans.
PG  - 443-452
LID - 10.18865/ed.27.4.443 [doi]
AB  - The objectives of this study were to explore self-reported Internet and electronic 
      platforms used to search for and store medical and dental information among people 
      of Mexican origin. A sample of adults self-identified as European American (250) and 
      as Mexican American (255), residing in Central Indiana, answered a one-time survey 
      that included technology use questions and measured acculturation via the 
      Psychological-Behavioral Acculturation Scale. Overall use of information 
      technologies was estimated through an Information and Communication Technology 
      score. Overall, participants with higher scores searched online for general and oral 
      health information at higher rates than those with lower scores. Younger Mexican 
      Americans and those with higher use scores were more likely to search online for 
      general health information, as were those more psychologically and behaviorally 
      acculturated. Interestingly, Mexican Americans were more likely than European 
      Americans to search online for dental health information. All participants 
      demonstrated high interest in accessing and storing their own health information 
      especially on paper format; storage in other places, such as personal computers, 
      smartphones, or USB flash drives, was less endorsed. Most participants would allow 
      spouses access to their health records; however, there were significant differences 
      between both population groups regarding access given to physicians, dentists and 
      other family members, with Mexican Americans reporting more restrictions. Our 
      findings provide initial information on differential use pattern of electronic 
      health resources among Mexican Americans and suggest that new information 
      technologies reach population groups traditionally underserved; such features may 
      help address disparities in general and dental health.

TI  - Idiosyncratic Drug Induced Liver Injury in African-Americans Is Associated With 
      Greater Morbidity and Mortality Compared to Caucasians.
PG  - 1382-1388
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2017.215 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Idiosyncratic drug induced liver injury (DILI) is a rare but potentially 
      serious liver disorder and a major cause of significant liver injury. Limited data 
      exist on racial differences in DILI incidence, presentation, and course. METHODS: We 
      compared the causative agents, clinical features, and outcomes of DILI among 
      self-described African-Americans and non-Hispanic whites (Caucasians) enrolled in 
      the DILIN Prospective Study. Individuals with definite, highly likely, or probable 
      DILI enrolled between September 2004 and February 2016 were included in this 
      analysis. RESULTS: 144 African-Americans and 841 Caucasian patients met the 
      eligibility criteria. Causal medications varied by race: 
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole being the most common cause among African-Americans 
      (7.6 vs. 3.6%) followed by methyldopa (4 vs. <1%), phenytoin (5 vs. <1%), isoniazid 
      (4 vs. 4%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (4.1 vs. 13.4%). The severity of illness, 
      however, tended to be greater in African-Americans than Caucasians as determined by 
      peak mean bilirubin (14.3 vs. 12.8 mg/dl), INR (1.9 vs. 1.6), and DILIN severity 
      score (3.0 vs. 2.6). The frequency of severe cutaneous reactions was significantly 
      higher in African-Americans (2.1 vs. 0.36% in Caucasians, P=0.048). 
      African-Americans also had higher rates of hospitalization (76.7 vs. 57.6%, 
      P<0.001), liver transplantation or liver related death by 6 months (10.2 vs. 5.8%, 
      P=0.02 after controlling for selected covariates), and chronic DILI (24 vs. 16%, 
      P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The most common DILI causative agents differ between 
      African-Americans and Caucasians. African-Americans are more likely to have severe 
      cutaneous reactions and more severe liver injury leading to worse outcomes, 
      including death and liver transplant.

TI  - Access to Recovery and Recidivism Among Former Prison Inmates.
PG  - 874-893
LID - 10.1177/0306624X15606688 [doi]
AB  - Access to Recovery (ATR) is a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
      Administration (SAMHSA)-funded initiative that offers a mix of clinical and 
      supportive services for substance abuse. ATR clients choose which services will help 
      to overcome barriers in their road to recovery, and a recovery consultant provides 
      vouchers and helps link the client to these community resources. One of ATR's goals 
      was to provide services to those involved in the criminal justice system in the 
      hopes that addressing substance abuse issues could reduce subsequent criminal 
      behaviors. This study examines this goal by looking at recidivism among a sample of 
      clients in one state's ATR program who returned to the community after 
      incarceration. Results suggest that there were few differential effects of service 
      selections on subsequent recidivism. However, there are significant differences in 
      recidivism rates among the agencies that provided ATR services. Agencies with more 
      resources and a focus on prisoner reentry had better recidivism outcomes than those 
      that focus only on substance abuse services.

TI  - Does a Crossover Age Effect Exist for African American and Hispanic Binge Drinkers? 
      Findings from the 2010 to 2013 National Study on Drug Use and Health.
PG  - 1129-1136
LID - 10.1111/acer.13380 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among general population studies, lower rates of binge drinking tend to 
      be found among African Americans and Hispanics compared to Whites. However, among 
      older adult populations, minority groups have been shown to be at higher risk for 
      binge drinking, suggesting the presence of a crossover effect from low to high risk 
      as a function of age. To date, limited research has examined the crossover effect 
      among African American and Hispanic populations compared to non-Hispanic Whites 
      across large developmental time frames or explored variation in risk based on income 
      or gender. This study aimed to fill these gaps in the literature. METHODS: Data were 
      compiled from the 2010 to 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health surveys, which 
      provide annual, nationally representative data on substance use behaviors among 
      individuals aged 12 and older. Hispanic, non-Hispanic African American, and 
      non-Hispanic White respondents were included (N = 205,198) in the analyses. RESULTS: 
      A crossover effect was found for African American males and females among the lowest 
      income level (i.e., incomes less than $20,000). Specifically, after controlling for 
      education and marital status, compared to Whites, risk for binge drinking was lower 
      for African American males at ages 18 to 24 and for females at ages 18 to 34, but 
      higher for both African American males and females at ages 50 to 64. No crossover 
      effect was found for Hispanic respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Although African Americans 
      are generally at lower risk for binge drinking, risk appears to increase 
      disproportionately with age among those who are impoverished. Explanatory factors, 
      such as social determinants of health prevalent within low-income African American 
      communities (e.g., lower education, violence exposure, housing insecurity) and 
      potential areas for intervention programming are discussed.

TI  - Impact of Bridging Income Generation with Group Integrated Care (BIGPIC) on 
      Hypertension and Diabetes in Rural Western Kenya.
PG  - 540-548
LID - 10.1007/s11606-016-3918-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rural settings in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) consistently report low 
      participation in non-communicable disease (NCD) treatment programs and poor 
      outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the 
      implementation of a patient-centered rural NCD care delivery model called Bridging 
      Income Generation through grouP Integrated Care (BIGPIC). DESIGN: The study 
      prospectively tracked participation and health outcomes for participants in a 
      screening event and compared linkage frequencies to a historical comparison group. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Rural Kenyan participants attending a voluntary NCD screening event 
      were included within the BIGPIC model of care. INTERVENTIONS: The BIGPIC model 
      utilizes a contextualized care delivery model designed to address the unique 
      barriers faced in rural settings. This model emphasizes the following steps: (1) 
      find patients in the community, (2) link to peer/microfinance groups, (3) integrate 
      education, (4) treat in the community, (5) enhance economic sustainability and (6) 
      generate demand for care through incentives. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome is 
      the linkage frequency, which measures the percentage of patients who return for care 
      after screening positive for either hypertension and/or diabetes. Secondary measures 
      include retention frequencies defined as the percentage of patients remaining 
      engaged in care throughout the 9-month follow-up period and changes in systolic 
      (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and blood sugar over 12 months. KEY 
      RESULTS: Of the 879 individuals who were screened, 14.2 % were confirmed to have 
      hypertension, while only 1.4 % were confirmed to have diabetes. The implementation 
      of a comprehensive microfinance-linked, community-based, group care model resulted 
      in 72.4 % of screen-positive participants returning for subsequent care, of which 
      70.3 % remained in care through the 12 months of the evaluation period. Patients 
      remaining in care demonstrated a statistically significant mean decline of 21 mmHg 
      in SBP [95 % CI (13.9 to 28.4), P < 0.01] and 5 mmHg drop in DBP [95 % CI (1.4 to 
      7.6), P < 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a contextualized care delivery 
      model built around the unique needs of rural SSA participants led to statistically 
      significant improvements in linkage to care and blood pressure reduction.

TI  - Drivers and Barriers for Adopting Accreditation at Local Health Departments for 
      Their Performance Improvement Effort.
PG  - e25-e35
LID - 10.1097/PHH.0000000000000567 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: A national system of voluntary public health accreditation for state, 
      local, and tribal health departments (local health departments [LHDs]) is part of a 
      movement that aims to improve public health performance with ultimate impact on 
      population health outcomes. Indiana is a good setting for the study of LHD 
      accreditation adoption because several LHDs reported de-adopting accreditation in a 
      recent statewide survey and because 71% of Indiana counties serve populations of 50 
      000 or less. DESIGN: A systematic method of analyzing qualitative data based on the 
      Performance Improvement Model framework to expand our understanding of de-adoption 
      of public health accreditation. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: In 2015, we conducted a key 
      informant interview study of the 3 LHDs that decided to delay their engagement in 
      the accreditation based on findings from an Indiana survey on LHD accreditation 
      adoption. The study is an exploration of LHD accreditation de-adoption and of the 
      contributions made to its understanding by the Performance Improvement Model. 
      RESULT: The study found that top management team members are those who champion 
      accreditation adoption, and that organizational structure and culture facilitate the 
      staff's embracing of the change. The Performance Improvement Model was found to 
      enhance the elucidation of the inner domain elements of Consolidated Framework for 
      Implementation Research in the context of de-adoption of public health 
      accreditation. CONCLUSION: Governing entities' policies and priorities appear to 
      mediate whether the LHDs are able to continue accreditation pursuit. Lacking any of 
      these driving forces appears to be associated with decisions to de-adoption of 
      accreditation. Further work is necessary to discern specific elements mediating 
      decisions to pursue accreditation. This study demonstrates the added knowledge of 
      Performance Improvement Model (PIM) to the CFIR framework. A large scale study is 
      called to further clarify and discern supports of specific to the needs of 
      individual LHDs for their performance improvement effort.

AB  - To determine the preliminary effectiveness of breast cancer screening among Chinese 
      females, 1226714 women aged 35-69 years first received clinical breast examinations. 
      Urban women with suspected cancer received mammography followed by breast ultrasound 
      (BUS), while rural suspected women underwent BUS followed by mammography. After 
      one-year follow-up, 223 and 431 breast cancers were detected among urban and rural 
      women (respectively), with overall detection rates of 0.56/1000 and 0.52/1000. 
      Higher detection rates were significantly associated with older age at screening for 
      both urban and rural women; additionally, urban women were at significantly higher 
      risk if they had no job, no insurance, or were obese; additional risk factors 
      specific to rural women included Han nationality, higher income, being unmarried, 
      and having a family history of cancer (all P values < 0.05). Among 
      screening-detected breast cancers in urban vs. rural women, 46.2% and 38.8% 
      (respectively) were early stage, 62.5% and 66.3% were ≤2 centimeters, 38.0% and 
      47.3% included lymph-node involvement, and 14.0% and 6.0% were identified as 
      carcinoma in situ. All abovementioned cancer characteristics were significantly 
      better than clinic-detected cancers (all P values < 0.001). In conclusion, several 
      important differences were found between urban and rural women in screening 
      effectiveness and patterns of cancer distribution.

TI  - Psychological and behavioral acculturation in a social network of Mexican Americans 
      in the United States and use of dental services.
PG  - 540-548

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We used data from the TalaSurvey study to examine associations between 
      dental health experiences, social network characteristics, and levels of behavioral 
      and psychological acculturation in one location in the American Midwest. METHODS: 
      Starting in parishes and community organizations, we identified adults of Mexican 
      origin living in Indianapolis, who were 1st- or 2nd-generation immigrants from Tala, 
      Mexico. Using a social networks methodology and following extensive formative 
      research, we created an egocentric social network survey and administered it via 
      face-to-face interviews. We identified the peers (alters) in interviewees' (egos) 
      personal networks. We asked egos about multiple oral health and dental care 
      variables for self and for alters. Acculturation (psychological and behavioral) was 
      measured with a validated tool. Through logistic and negative binomial regression, 
      we examined the effects of acculturation and network composition on ego's dental 
      insurance status, dental office visits, and the reason for most recent dental office 
      visit. RESULTS: A total of 332 egos (mean age 36; 63% female) were interviewed: 90% 
      were born in Mexico; 45% had completed elementary school or lower; and most had low 
      income. Each ego named 3.9 (SD±1.9) alters in his/her personal network, for a total 
      of 1299 alters (mean age 39; 61% female). Both behavioral acculturation and 
      psychological acculturation were moderately associated with dental insurance 
      coverage, and greater behavioral acculturation predicted more frequent dental care. 
      More psychologically acculturated egos were more likely to seek preventive care. 
      Further, egos with more highly educated networks sought care more frequently and for 
      preventive purposes, net of ego's own education and acculturation. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study contextualizes acculturation of Mexican Americans within the personal networks 
      in which oral health discussion takes place. The findings underscore the critical 
      importance of acculturation and social network factors in shaping a subgroup of 
      Latinos' orientation toward dental care.

TI  - Differences in risk behaviours, HIV/STI testing and HIV/STI prevalence between men 
      who have sex with men and men who have sex with both men and women in China.
PG  - 840-9
LID - 10.1177/0956462415596302 [doi]
AB  - Differences in risk behaviours between men who have sex with men (MSM) and men who 
      have sex with both men and women (MSMW) have important implications for HIV and 
      sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission. We examined differences in risk 
      behaviours, HIV/STI testing, self-reported HIV/STI diagnoses, and linkage to HIV 
      care between MSM and MSMW across China. Participants were recruited through three 
      MSM-focused websites in China. An online survey containing items on 
      socio-demographics, risk behaviours, testing history, self-reported HIV/STI 
      diagnosis, and linkage to and retention in HIV care was completed from September to 
      October 2014. Chi square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted. MSMW 
      were less likely to use a condom during last anal sex (p ≤ 0.01) and more likely to 
      engage in group sex (p ≤ 0.01) and transactional sex (p ≤ 0.01) compared to MSM. 
      Self-reported HIV/STI testing and positivity rates between MSM and MSMW were 
      similar. Among HIV-infected MSM, there was no difference in rates of linkage to or 
      retention in antiretroviral therapy when comparing MSM and MSMW. Chinese MSM and 
      MSMW may benefit from different HIV and STI intervention and prevention strategies. 
      Achieving a successful decrease in HIV/STI epidemics among Chinese MSM and MSMW will 
      depend on the ability of targeted and culturally congruent HIV/STI control 
      programmes to facilitate a reduction in risk behaviours.

TI  - Relationship Between African-American Race and Delirium in the ICU.
PG  - 1727-34
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000001813 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a highly prevalent syndrome of acute brain dysfunction among 
      critically ill patients that has been linked to multiple risk factors, such as age, 
      preexisting cognitive impairment, and use of sedatives; but to date, the 
      relationship between race and delirium is unclear. We conducted this study to 
      identify whether African-American race is a risk factor for developing ICU delirium. 
      DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical and surgical ICUs of a 
      university-affiliated, safety net hospital in Indianapolis, IN. PATIENTS: A total of 
      2,087 consecutive admissions with 1,008 African Americans admitted to the ICU 
      services from May 2009 to August 2012. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: Incident delirium was defined as first positive Confusion Assessment Method 
      for the ICU result after an initial negative Confusion Assessment Method for the 
      ICU; and prevalent delirium was defined as positive Confusion Assessment Method for 
      the ICU on first Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU assessment. The overall 
      incident delirium rate in African Americans was 8.7% compared with 10.4% in 
      Caucasians (p = 0.26). The prevalent delirium rate was 14% in both African Americans 
      and Caucasians (p = 0.95). Significant age and race interactions were detected for 
      incident delirium (p = 0.02) but not for prevalent delirium (p = 0.3). The hazard 
      ratio for incident delirium for African Americans in the 18-49 years age group 
      compared with Caucasians of similar age was 0.4 (0.1-0.9). The hazard and odds 
      ratios for incident and prevalent delirium in other groups were not different. 
      CONCLUSIONS: African-American race does not confer any additional risk for 
      developing incident or prevalent delirium in the ICU. Instead, younger African 
      Americans tend to have lower rates of incident delirium compared with Caucasians of 
      similar age.

AB  - Losses to follow-up (LTFU) remain an important programmatic challenge. While 
      numerous patient-level factors have been associated with LTFU, less is known about 
      facility-level factors. Data from the East African International epidemiologic 
      Databases to Evaluate AIDS (EA-IeDEA) Consortium was used to identify facility-level 
      factors associated with LTFU in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Patients were defined as 
      LTFU if they had no visit within 12 months of the study endpoint for pre-ART 
      patients or 6 months for patients on ART. Adjusting for patient factors, shared 
      frailty proportional hazard models were used to identify the facility-level factors 
      associated with LTFU for the pre- and post-ART periods. Data from 77,362 patients 
      and 29 facilities were analyzed. Median age at enrolment was 36.0 years 
      (Interquartile Range: 30.1, 43.1), 63.9% were women and 58.3% initiated ART. Rates 
      (95% Confidence Interval) of LTFU were 25.1 (24.7-25.6) and 16.7 (16.3-17.2) per 100 
      person-years in the pre-ART and post-ART periods, respectively. Facility-level 
      factors associated with increased LTFU included secondary-level care, HIV RNA PCR 
      turnaround time >14 days, and no onsite availability of CD4 testing. Increased LTFU 
      was also observed when no nutritional supplements were provided (pre-ART only), when 
      TB patients were treated within the HIV program (pre-ART only), and when the 
      facility was open ≤4 mornings per week (ART only). Our findings suggest that 
      facility-based strategies such as point of care laboratory testing and separate 
      clinic spaces for TB patients may improve retention.

TI  - Depression, suicidal ideation, and related factors of methadone maintenance 
      treatment users in Guangzhou, China.
PG  - 851-6
LID - 10.1080/09540121.2015.1124981 [doi]
AB  - Mental health problems are prevalent among drug users. Methadone maintenance 
      treatment (MMT) is an evidence-based effective treatment for drug addiction; 
      however, there are few studies investigating depression, suicidal ideation, and 
      their related factors among MMT users. In this cross-sectional study, 648 MMT users 
      were recruited from six MMT clinics in Guangzhou, China. Data were collected through 
      face-to-face interviews by trained interviewers. Of all participants, 270 (42.7%) 
      exhibited probable depression (Depression Subscale of the Chinese short version of 
      Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-D), score ≥ 10) and 99 (15.3%) reported 
      having suicidal ideation in the last six months. After adjusting for significant 
      socio-demographic characteristics, all studied variables, including drug use 
      history, social support, family support for MMT use, and satisfaction toward MMT 
      services were significantly associated with both probable depression and suicidal 
      ideation in the last six months. Furthermore, depression fully mediated the 
      associations between drug use history, satisfaction toward MMT services, and 
      suicidal ideation. In the final multivariate models, probable depression was 
      associated with social support (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.83-0.93) and satisfaction 
      toward MMT services provided by doctors (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.40-0.86), while for 
      suicidal ideation, social support (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.78-0.92) and probable 
      depression (OR = 5.94, 95% CI = 3.39-10.42) were significant. The findings suggest 
      that there are unmet mental health needs among MMT users. For countries with limited 
      resources of psychological services, mental health care toward MMT users should be 
      implanted into current health care settings and incorporate components such as 
      social support, family's understanding of MMT, and service satisfaction.

TI  - Untangling the Relationship Between Antiretroviral Therapy Use and Incident 
      Pregnancy: A Marginal Structural Model Analysis Using Data From 47,313 HIV-Positive 
      Women in East Africa.
PG  - 324-32
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000000963 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scale-up of triple-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa has 
      transformed the context of childbearing for HIV-positive women and may impact 
      pregnancy incidence in HIV programs. METHODS: Using observational data from 47,313 
      HIV-positive women enrolled at 26 HIV clinics in Kenya and Uganda between 2001 and 
      2009, we calculated the crude cumulative incidence of pregnancy for the pre-ART and 
      on-ART periods. The causal effect of ART use on incident pregnancy was assessed 
      using inverse probability weighted marginal structural models, and the relationship 
      was further explored in multivariable Cox models. RESULTS: Crude cumulative 
      pregnancy incidence at 1 year after enrollment/ART initiation was 4.0% and 3.9% 
      during the pre-ART and on-ART periods, respectively. In marginal structural models, 
      ART use was not significantly associated with incident pregnancy [hazard ratio = 
      1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99 to 1.12]. Similarly, in Cox models, there 
      was no significant relationship between ART use and incident pregnancy 
      (cause-specific hazard ratio: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.05), but effect modification 
      was observed. Specifically, women who were pregnant at enrollment and on ART had an 
      increased risk of incident pregnancy compared to those not pregnant at enrollment 
      and not on ART (cause-specific hazard ratio: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.23). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort, ART initiation was not associated with incident 
      pregnancy in the general population of women enrolling in HIV care but rather only 
      among those pregnant at enrollment. This finding further highlights the importance 
      of scaling up access to lifelong treatment for pregnant women.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test an intervention to increase mammography 
      screening in women 51-75 years of age who had not received a mammogram in the last 
      15 months. A total of 1681 women were randomized to (1) a mailed tailored 
      interactive DVD, (2) a computer-tailored telephone counseling, or (3) usual care. 
      Women with income below US$75,000 who were in the interactive DVD group had 
      significantly more mammograms than women in usual care. Women with income above 
      US$75,000 had significantly fewer mammograms than women with income less than 
      US$75,000 regardless of group. Further investigation is needed to understand why 
      women with income above US$75,000 did not show the same benefit of the intervention.

TI  - Racial differences in dietary changes and quality of life after a colorectal cancer 
      diagnosis: a follow-up of the Study of Outcomes in Colorectal Cancer Survivors 
      cohort.
PG  - 1523-30
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.115.126276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Substantial racial disparities exist in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      survival. OBJECTIVE: This was an exploratory study to assess the racial differences 
      in dietary changes in relation to quality of life (QoL), recurrence, and survival 
      after a CRC diagnosis. DESIGN: Four hundred fifty-three stage II CRC patients were 
      enrolled in the cohort study through the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry. 
      Self-reported diet, physical activity, treatment, comorbidities, demographic 
      characteristics, and QoL were collected at diagnosis and 12 and 24 mo after 
      diagnosis. QoL was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
      Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) and the Medical Outcomes 12-Item Short Form Health 
      Survey (SF-12) inventories. An overall dietary index score was calculated. 
      Generalized estimating equations and logistic regression models were used to explore 
      potential associations. Statistical power for this study was ∼50%. RESULTS: African 
      Americans (n = 81) were more likely to increase intakes of reduced-fat milk, 
      vegetables, and fruit and decrease intakes of regular cheese, red meat, fried food, 
      fast food, and fat (P < 0.05) than were Caucasians (n = 184) 24 mo after diagnosis. 
      The least-squares means ± SEs for changes in dietary index were 6.05 ± 0.40 and 4.07 
      ± 0.27 for African Americans and Caucasians, respectively (P < 0.001). African 
      Americans exhibited higher scores on portions of the FACT-C (colorectal cancer 
      subscale: β = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.82) and the SF-12 (Physical Component Summary: β 
      = 2.49; 95% CI: 0.51, 4.48). Those who improved their dietary quality over 24 mo had 
      lower risk of recurrence and mortality combined (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.72). 
      CONCLUSIONS: African Americans made more healthful changes in diet and had a higher 
      QoL than did Caucasians in this underpowered study that used self-reported dietary 
      data. No racial differences in recurrence or survival were evident, although 
      improvements in dietary quality did reveal survival benefits overall. More 
      prospective research on racial disparities in health behavior changes after 
      diagnosis is desperately needed.

TI  - Randomized controlled pilot trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast 
      and colorectal cancer survivors: effects on cancer-related cognitive impairment.
PG  - 437-48
LID - 10.1007/s11764-015-0494-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a common, fatigue-related 
      symptom that disrupts cancer survivors' quality of life. Few interventions for CRCI 
      exist. As part of a randomized pilot study targeting cancer-related fatigue, the 
      effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on survivors' cognitive 
      outcomes were investigated. METHODS: Breast and colorectal cancer survivors (n = 71) 
      with moderate-to-severe fatigue were randomized to MBSR (n = 35) or a fatigue 
      education and support (ES; n = 36) condition. The Attentional Function Index (AFI) 
      and the Stroop test were used to assess survivors' cognitive function at baseline 
      (T1), after the 8-week intervention period (T2), and 6 months later (T3) using 
      intent-to-treat analysis. Mediation analyses were performed to explore mechanisms of 
      intervention effects on cognitive functioning. RESULTS: MBSR participants reported 
      significantly greater improvement on the AFI total score compared to ES participants 
      at T2 (d = 0.83, p = 0.001) and T3 (d = 0.55, p = 0.021). MBSR also significantly 
      outperformed ES on most AFI subscales, although both groups improved over time. MBSR 
      produced greater Stroop accuracy rates relative to ES at T2 (r = 0.340, p = 0.005) 
      and T3 (r = 0.280, p = 0.030), with improved accuracy over time only for the MBSR 
      group. There were no significant differences in Stroop reaction time between groups. 
      Improvements in mindfulness mediated the effect of group (e.g., MBSR vs. ES) on AFI 
      total score at T2 and T3. CONCLUSIONS: Additional randomized trials with more 
      comprehensive cognitive measures are warranted to definitively assess the efficacy 
      of MBSR for CRCI. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: This pilot study has important 
      implications for all cancer survivors as it is the first published trial to show 
      that MBSR offers robust and durable improvements in CRCI.

TI  - Retention in Care and Patient-Reported Reasons for Undocumented Transfer or Stopping 
      Care Among HIV-Infected Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy in Eastern Africa: 
      Application of a Sampling-Based Approach.
PG  - 935-944
LID - 10.1093/cid/civ1004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving the implementation of the global response to human 
      immunodeficiency virus requires understanding retention after starting 
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), but loss to follow-up undermines assessment of the 
      magnitude of and reasons for stopping care. METHODS: We evaluated adults starting 
      ART over 2.5 years in 14 clinics in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. We traced a random 
      sample of patients lost to follow-up and incorporated updated information in 
      weighted competing risks estimates of retention. Reasons for nonreturn were 
      surveyed. RESULTS: Among 18 081 patients, 3150 (18%) were lost to follow-up and 579 
      (18%) were traced. Of 497 (86%) with ascertained vital status, 340 (69%) were alive 
      and, in 278 (82%) cases, updated care status was obtained. Among all patients 
      initiating ART, weighted estimates incorporating tracing outcomes found that 2 years 
      after ART, 69% were in care at their original clinic, 14% transferred (4% official 
      and 10% unofficial), 6% were alive but out of care, 6% died in care (<60 days after 
      last visit), and 6% died out of care (≥ 60 days after last visit). Among lost 
      patients found in care elsewhere, structural barriers (eg, transportation) were most 
      prevalent (65%), followed by clinic-based (eg, waiting times) (33%) and psychosocial 
      (eg, stigma) (27%). Among patients not in care elsewhere, psychosocial barriers were 
      most prevalent (76%), followed by structural (51%) and clinic based (15%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for outcomes among those lost to follow-up yields a more 
      informative assessment of retention. Structural barriers contribute most to silent 
      transfers, whereas psychological and social barriers tend to result in longer-term 
      care discontinuation.

TI  - Satisfaction with cancer care among underserved racial-ethnic minorities and 
      lower-income patients receiving patient navigation.
PG  - 1060-7
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29902 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient navigation is a barrier-focused program of care coordination 
      designed to achieve timely and high-quality cancer-related care for medically 
      underserved racial-ethnic minorities and the poor. However, to the authors' 
      knowledge, few studies to date have examined the relationship between satisfaction 
      with navigators and cancer-related care. METHODS: The authors included data from 
      1345 patients with abnormal cancer screening tests or a definitive cancer diagnosis 
      who participated in the Patient Navigation Research Program to test the efficacy of 
      patient navigation. Participants completed demographic questionnaires and measures 
      of patient satisfaction with cancer-related care (PSCC) and patient satisfaction 
      with interpersonal relationship with navigator (PSN-I). The authors obtained 
      descriptive statistics to characterize the sample and conducted regression analyses 
      to assess the degree of association between PSN-I and PSCC, controlling for 
      demographic and clinical factors. Analyses of variance were conducted to examine 
      group differences controlling for statistically significant covariates. RESULTS: 
      Statistically significant relationships were found between the PSCC and PSN-I for 
      patients with abnormal cancer screening tests (1040 patients; correlation 
      coefficient (r), 0.4 [P<.001]) and those with a definitive cancer diagnosis (305 
      patients; correlation coefficient, 0.4 [P<.001]). The regression analysis indicated 
      that having an abnormal colorectal cancer screening test in the abnormal screening 
      test group and increased age and minority race-ethnicity status in the cancer 
      diagnosis group were associated with a higher satisfaction with cancer care (P<.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with navigators appears to be significantly associated 
      with satisfaction with cancer-related care. Information regarding the 
      patient-navigator relationship should be integrated into patient navigation programs 
      to maximize the likelihood of reducing caner disparities and mortality for medically 
      underserved racial-ethnic minorities and the poor.

TI  - A practical method for predicting frequent use of emergency department care using 
      routinely available electronic registration data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurately predicting future frequent emergency department (ED) 
      utilization can support a case management approach and ultimately reduce health care 
      costs. This study assesses the feasibility of using routinely collected registration 
      data to predict future frequent ED visits. METHOD: Using routinely collected 
      registration data in the state of Indiana, U.S.A., from 2008, we developed 
      multivariable logistic regression models to predict frequent ED visits in the 
      subsequent two years. We assessed the model's accuracy using Receiver Operating 
      Characteristic (ROC) curves, sensitivity, and positive predictive value (PPV). 
      RESULTS: Strong predictors of frequent ED visits included age between 25 and 
      44 years, female gender, close proximity to the ED (less than 5 miles traveling 
      distance), total visits in the baseline year, and respiratory and dental chief 
      complaint syndromes. The area under ROC curve (AUC) ranged from 0.83 to 0.92 for 
      models predicting patients with 8 or more visits to 16 or more visits in the 
      subsequent two years, suggesting acceptable discrimination. With 25 % sensitivity, 
      the model predicting frequent ED use as defined as 16 or more visits in 2009 and 
      2010 had a PPV of 59.5 % and specificity of 99.9 %. The "adjusted" PPV of this 
      model, which includes patients having 8 or more visits, is 81.9 %. CONCLUSION: We 
      demonstrate a strong association between predictor variables present in registration 
      data and frequent ED use. The algorithm's performance characteristics suggest that 
      it is technically feasible to use routinely collected registration data to predict 
      future frequent ED use.

TI  - Mammography Adherence in African-American Women: Results of a Randomized Controlled 
      Trial.
PG  - 70-8
LID - 10.1007/s12160-015-9733-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality among 
      women in the developed world. Mammography screening is especially important for 
      African-Americans because they experience a greater mortality (OR = 1.38) than 
      Caucasians despite having a lower incidence of breast cancer. PURPOSE: The purpose 
      of this study was to compare the effects of two interventions with usual care on 
      mammography adherence among African-American women. METHODS: A subsample of 
      African-American women (n = 244) aged 41-65 years who had not had a mammogram in the 
      last 15 months and no history of breast cancer was randomly assigned to receive (1) 
      mailed interactive DVD, (2) computer-tailored telephone counseling, or (3) usual 
      care. RESULTS: The DVD intervention was five times more effective than usual care 
      for promoting mammography screening at 6 months follow-up among women who earned 
      less than $30,000 (OR = 5.3). Compared to usual care, neither the DVD nor phone 
      produced significant effects for women with household incomes >$30,000. CONCLUSION: 
      Use of a mailed DVD for low-income African-American women may be an effective way to 
      increase mammography adherence.

AB  - The Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Health program provides the Veterans 
      Health Administration (VHA) a framework whereby VHA providers can access the 
      veterans' electronic health record information to coordinate healthcare across 
      multiple sites of care. As an early adopter of VLER, the Indianapolis VHA and 
      Regenstrief Institute implemented a regional demonstration program involving 
      bi-directional health information exchange (HIE) between VHA and non-VHA 
      providers.The aim of the study is to determine whether implementation of VLER HIE 
      reduces 1 year VHA medical costs.A cohort evaluation with a concurrent control group 
      compared VHA healthcare costs using propensity score adjustment. A CHEERs compliant 
      checklist was used to conduct the cost evaluation.Patients were enrolled in the VLER 
      program onsite at the Indianapolis VHA in outpatient clinics or through the 
      release-of-information office.VHA cost data (in 2014 dollars) were obtained for both 
      enrolled and nonenrolled (control) patients for 1 year prior to, and 1 year after, 
      the index date of patient enrollment.There were 6104 patients enrolled in VLER and 
      45,700 patients in the control group. The annual adjusted total cost difference per 
      patient was associated with a higher cost for VLER enrollees $1152 (95% CI: 
      $807-1433) (P < 0.01) (in 2014 dollars) than VLER nonenrollees.Short-term evaluation 
      of this demonstration project did not show immediate reductions in healthcare cost 
      as might be expected if HIE decreased redundant medical tests and treatments. Cost 
      reductions from shared health information may be realized with longer time horizons.

TI  - Association of ADIPOQ gene with type 2 diabetes and related phenotypes in African 
      American men and women: the Jackson Heart Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: African Americans experience disproportionately higher prevalence of 
      type 2 diabetes and related risk factors. Little research has been done on the 
      association of ADIPOQ gene on type 2 diabetes, plasma adiponectin, blood glucose, 
      HOMA-IR and body mass index (BMI) in African Americans. The objective of our 
      research was to assess such associations with selected SNPs. The study included a 
      sample of 3,020 men and women from the Jackson Heart Study who had ADIPOQ genotyping 
      information. Unadjusted and adjusted regression models with covariates were used 
      with type 2 diabetes and related phenotypes as the outcome stratified by sex. 
      RESULTS: There was no association between selected ADIPOQ SNPs with type 2 diabetes, 
      blood glucose, or BMI in men or women. There was a significant association between 
      variant rs16861205 and lower adiponectin in women with minor allele A in the fully 
      adjusted model (β(SE) p = -.13(0.05), 0.003). There was also a significant 
      association with variant rs7627128 and lower HOMA-IR among men with minor allele A 
      in the fully adjusted model (β(SE) p = -0.74(0.20), 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings represent new insights regarding the association of ADIPOQ gene and type 2 
      diabetes and related phenotypes in African American men and women.

TI  - Disparities in hypertension among black Caribbean populations: a scoping review by 
      the U.S. Caribbean Alliance for Health Disparities Research Group (USCAHDR).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the large body of research on racial/ethnic disparities in 
      health, there are limited data on health disparities in Caribbean-origin 
      populations. This scoping review aimed to analyze and synthesize published and 
      unpublished literature on the disparities in hypertension and its complications 
      among Afro-Caribbean populations. METHODS: A comprehensive protocol, including a 
      thorough search strategy, was developed and used to identify potentially relevant 
      studies. Identified studies were then screened for eligibility using pre-specified 
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. An extraction form was developed to chart data and 
      collate study characteristics including methods and main findings. Charted 
      information was tagged by disparity indicators and thematic analysis performed. 
      Disparity indicators evaluated include ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, 
      disability, sexual orientation and geographic location. Gaps in the literature were 
      identified and extrapolated into a gap map. RESULTS: A total of 455 hypertension 
      related records, published between 1972 and 2012, were identified and screened. 
      Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria for detailed analysis. The majority of 
      studies were conducted in the United Kingdom and utilized a cross-sectional study 
      design. Overall, studies reported a higher prevalence of hypertension among 
      Caribbean blacks compared to West African blacks and Caucasians. Hypertension and 
      its related complications were highest in persons with low socioeconomic status. Gap 
      analysis showed limited research data reporting hypertension incidence by sex and 
      socioeconomic status. No literature was found on disability status or sexual 
      orientation as it relates to hypertension. Prevalence and morbidity were the most 
      frequently reported outcomes. CONCLUSION: The literature on hypertension health 
      disparities in Caribbean origin populations is limited. Future research should 
      address these knowledge gaps and develop approaches to reduce them.

TI  - Big city, small world: density, contact rates, and transmission of dengue across

AB  - Macroscopic descriptions of populations commonly assume that encounters between 
      individuals are well mixed; i.e. each individual has an equal chance of coming into 
      contact with any other individual. Relaxing this assumption can be challenging 
      though, due to the difficulty of acquiring detailed knowledge about the non-random 
      nature of encounters. Here, we fitted a mathematical model of dengue virus 
      transmission to spatial time-series data from Pakistan and compared 
      maximum-likelihood estimates of 'mixing parameters' when disaggregating data across 
      an urban-rural gradient. We show that dynamics across this gradient are subject not 
      only to differing transmission intensities but also to differing strengths of 
      nonlinearity due to differences in mixing. Accounting for differences in mobility by 
      incorporating two fine-scale, density-dependent covariate layers eliminates 
      differences in mixing but results in a doubling of the estimated transmission 
      potential of the large urban district of Lahore. We furthermore show that neglecting 
      spatial variation in mixing can lead to substantial underestimates of the level of 
      effort needed to control a pathogen with vaccines or other interventions. We 
      complement this analysis with estimates of the relationships between dengue 
      transmission intensity and other putative environmental drivers thereof.

TI  - Predicting Liver Transplant Capacity Using Discrete Event Simulation.
PG  - 784-96
LID - 10.1177/0272989X14559055 [doi]
AB  - The number of liver transplants (LTs) performed in the US increased until 2006 but 
      has since declined despite an ongoing increase in demand. This decline may be due in 
      part to decreased donor liver quality and increasing discard of poor-quality livers. 
      We constructed a discrete event simulation (DES) model informed by current donor 
      characteristics to predict future LT trends through the year 2030. The data source 
      for our model is the United Network for Organ Sharing database, which contains 
      patient-level information on all organ transplants performed in the US. Previous 
      analysis showed that liver discard is increasing and that discarded organs are more 
      often from donors who are older, are obese, have diabetes, and donated after cardiac 
      death. Given that the prevalence of these factors is increasing, the DES model 
      quantifies the reduction in the number of LTs performed through 2030. In addition, 
      the model estimatesthe total number of future donors needed to maintain the current 
      volume of LTs and the effect of a hypothetical scenario of improved reperfusion 
      technology.We also forecast the number of patients on the waiting list and compare 
      this with the estimated number of LTs to illustrate the impact that decreased LTs 
      will have on patients needing transplants. By altering assumptions about the future 
      donor pool, this model can be used to develop policy interventions to prevent a 
      further decline in this lifesaving therapy. To our knowledge, there are no similar 
      predictive models of future LT use based on epidemiological trends.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer and its treatments can deleteriously affect memory. Cardiac 
      function and insomnia can exacerbate memory problems. OBJECTIVE: To examine the 
      relationships among cardiovascular disease, insomnia, and self-reported memory 
      problems (SRMP) in adult-onset cancer survivors. METHODS: We included data from 
      participants (41-64 year-old) of the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey, a nationally representative probability sample of the civilian, 
      non-institutionalized population of the US. We excluded participants with brain 
      cancer/stroke history since these conditions are expected to cause cognitive 
      problems. Using binary logistic regression, we determined the prevalence of SRMP 
      relative to cardiac problems and insomnia by weighting our results proportionally. 
      We adjusted for predictors of memory problems: age, sex, race, education and general 
      health. RESULTS: The sample included 2289 adults (49% females), 9% with a cancer 
      history. The results pertain only to cancer survivors. Those with insomnia were 16 
      times as likely to have SRMP. Only insomnia symptoms (OR, 15.74; 95% CI, 
      1.73-143.30; p < 0.01) significantly predicted SRMP, uniquely explaining 12% of the 
      variance. Insomnia accounted for 18.8% of the association between cardiac issues and 
      SRMP, demonstrating mediation (Sobel p < 0.05). The large CI is a consequence of 
      analyzing a sub-group of a subpopulation. Among participants without a cancer 
      history, cardiovascular disease and insomnia were not associated with SRMP 
      (p > 0.05). LIMITATIONS: We could not determine severity and time-related changes in 
      SRMP. CONCLUSION: Likelihood of SRMP was higher in cancer survivors with a history 
      of cardiovascular disease and insomnia symptoms. Future studies are needed to 
      delineate the cardiac-insomnia-memory interrelationships.

TI  - Cervical cancer screening in a sexually transmitted disease clinic: screening 
      adoption experiences from a midwestern clinic.
PG  - e8-14
LID - 10.2105/AJPH.2014.302272 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined whether a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic could 
      reach women who had not received a Papanicolau (Pap) test in the past 3 years. We 
      also explored staff attitudes and implementation of cervical cancer screening. 
      METHODS: Women (n = 123) aged 30 to 50 years were offered cervical cancer screening 
      in an Indiana STD clinic. We measured effectiveness by the patients' self-reported 
      last Pap test. We explored adoption of screening through focus groups with 34 staff 
      members by documenting their attitudes about cervical cancer screening and screening 
      strategy adaptation. We also documented recruitment and screening implementation. 
      RESULTS: Almost half (47.9%) of participants reported a last Pap test 3 or more 
      years previously; 30% had reported a last Pap more than 5 years ago, and 11.4% had a 
      high-risk test outcome that required referral to colposcopy. Staff supported 
      screening because of mission alignment and perceived patient benefit. Screening 
      adaptations included eligibility, results provision, and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cervical cancer screening was possible and potentially beneficial in STD clinics. 
      Future effectiveness-implementation studies should expand to include all female 
      patients, and should examine the degree to which adaptation of selected adoption 
      frameworks is feasible.

TI  - Pharmacists' experiences with a telephonic medication therapy management program for 
      home health care patients.
PG  - 163-74
LID - 10.4140/TCP.n.2015.163 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to better understand perceived barriers and 
      facilitators to providing medication therapy management (MTM) services by 
      pharmacists who recently provided telephonic MTM services to home health care 
      patients. These services were provided as part of a randomized, controlled trial 
      (RCT) to develop suggested quality improvement strategies for future service design. 
      DESIGN: This was a qualitative study. A semi-structured individual interview format 
      was used to elicit responses. SETTING: Interviews were conducted by phone with 
      participants. PARTICIPANTS: All pharmacists who recently provided telephonic MTM 
      services as a part of an RCT participated in this study. INTERVENTIONS: Pharmacists 
      were asked questions regarding their perceptions of the services, training 
      opportunities, patient perceptions of the services, interactions with physicians, 
      and suggestions for improvement. General demographic information was collected for 
      each pharmacist and summarized using descriptive statistics. Interview data were 
      analyzed using inductive qualitative methods to reveal key themes related to 
      facilitators and barriers of MTM services in home health care patients. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The main outcome measures were major themes identified from pharmacist 
      interviews pertaining to barriers, facilitators, and quality improvement strategies 
      for telephonic MTM delivery. RESULTS: A total of four pharmacists (i.e., 100% of 
      those who participated in the prior RCT) were interviewed. Several themes emerged 
      from the analysis, including: communication and relationships, coordinating care and 
      patient self-management, logistics, professional fulfillment, service delivery and 
      content, and training opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides possible 
      strategies to overcome barriers and facilitate service provision for future 
      telephonic MTM services.

TI  - Perceptions of Spanish-speaking clientele of patient care services in a community 
      pharmacy.
PG  - 241-52
LID - S1551-7411(14)00105-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.sapharm.2014.07.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A paucity of studies exists that have assessed community pharmacy 
      preferences of Spanish-speaking patients living in areas of the U.S. with rapidly 
      growing Hispanic populations. The qualitative approach to this research affords a 
      unique opportunity to further explore perceptions of the Spanish-speaking 
      population. OBJECTIVES: To identify perceptions of Spanish-speaking patients living 
      in the U.S. with a focus on the care provided in community pharmacies, as well as to 
      determine their satisfaction with community pharmacies. METHODS: Participants were 
      recruited after weekly Spanish-speaking church services for approximately one month. 
      Qualitative, semi-structured individual interviews to identify perceived unmet 
      patient care needs were conducted in Spanish and transcribed/translated verbatim. 
      Qualitative thematic analysis was used to summarize findings. A written 
      questionnaire was administered to collect patient satisfaction and demographic 
      information, summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Twelve interviews 
      were conducted by the principal investigator. Primary themes included lack of 
      insurance coupled with high medical care costs serving as a barrier for acquisition 
      of health care, difficulty accessing timely and convenient primary care, perceived 
      negative attitudes from pharmacy personnel, lack of Spanish-speaking health care 
      providers, and the provision of verbal and written medication information in 
      English. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest a great need for health care 
      providers, including pharmacists, to expand outreach services to the 
      Spanish-speaking community. Some examples derived from the interview process include 
      increasing marketing efforts of available services in the Spanish language, hiring 
      Spanish-speaking personnel, and offering medical terminology education classes to 
      Spanish-speaking patients.

PG  - E162

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many US workers are increasingly delaying retirement from work, which 
      may be leading to an increase in chronic disease at the workplace. We examined the 
      association of older adults' health status with their employment/occupation and 
      other characteristics. METHODS: National Health Interview Survey data from 1997 
      through 2011 were pooled for adults aged 65 or older (n = 83,338; mean age, 74.6 y). 
      Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the association of 
      socioeconomic factors and health behaviors with 4 health status measures: 1) 
      self-rated health (fair/poor vs good/very good/excellent); 2) multimorbidity (≤1 vs 
      ≥2 chronic conditions); 3) multiple functional limitations (≤1 vs ≥2); and 4) Health 
      and Activities Limitation Index (HALex) (below vs above 20th percentile). Analyses 
      were stratified by sex and age (young-old vs old-old) where interactions with 
      occupation were significant. RESULTS: Employed older adults had better health 
      outcomes than unemployed older adults. Physically demanding occupations had the 
      lowest risk of poor health outcomes, suggesting a stronger healthy worker effect: 
      service workers were at lowest risk of multiple functional limitations (odds ratio 
      [OR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.95); and blue-collar workers were 
      at lowest risk of multimorbidity (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97) and multiple 
      functional limitation (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98). Hispanics were more likely than 
      non-Hispanic whites to report fair/poor health (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.52-1.73) and 
      lowest HALex quintile (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.13-1.30); however, they were less likely 
      to report multimorbidity (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.83) or multiple functional 
      limitations (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77-0.88). CONCLUSION: A strong association exists 
      between employment and health status in older adults beyond what can be explained by 
      socioeconomic factors (eg, education, income) or health behaviors (eg, smoking). 
      Disability accommodations in the workplace could encourage employment among older 
      adults with limitations.

TI  - Implementation and Operational Research: A Time-Motion Analysis of HIV Transmission 
      Prevention Counseling and Antiretroviral Adherence Messages in Western Kenya.
PG  - e135-41
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000000666 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shortages of health workers and large number of HIV-infected persons in 
      Africa mean that time to provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and other 
      messages to patients is limited. METHODS: Using time-motion methodology, we 
      documented the intensity and nature of counseling delivered to patients. The study 
      was conducted at a rural and an urban HIV clinic in western Kenya. We recorded all 
      activities of 190 adult patients on ART during their return clinic visits to assess 
      type, frequency, and duration of counseling messages. RESULTS: Mean visit length for 
      patients at the rural clinic was 44.5 (SD = 27.9) minutes and at urban clinic was 
      78.2 (SD = 42.1) minutes. Median time spent receiving any counseling during a visit 
      was 4.07 minutes [interquartile range (IQR), 1.57-7.33] at rural and 3.99 (IQR, 
      2.87-6.25) minutes at urban, representing 11% and 8% of total mean visit time, 
      respectively. Median time patients received ART adherence counseling was 1.29 (IQR, 
      0.77-2.83) minutes at rural and 1.76 (IQR, 1.23-2.83) minutes at urban (P = 0.001 
      for difference). Patients received a median time of 0.18 (0-0.72) minutes at rural 
      and 0.28 (IQR, 0-0.67) minutes at urban clinic of counseling regarding contraception 
      and pregnancy. Most patients in the study did not receive any counseling regarding 
      alcohol/substance use, emerging risks for ongoing HIV transmission. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although ART adherence was discussed with most patients, time was limited. 
      Reproductive counseling was provided to only half of the patients, and "positive 
      prevention" messaging was minimal. There are strategic opportunities to enhance 
      counseling and information received by clients within HIV programs in 
      resource-limited settings.

TI  - How bioethics principles can aid design of electronic health records to accommodate 
      patient granular control.
PG  - S3-6
LID - 10.1007/s11606-014-3062-z [doi]
AB  - Ethics should guide the design of electronic health records (EHR), and recognized 
      principles of bioethics can play an important role. This approach was recently 
      adopted by a team of informaticists who are designing and testing a system where 
      patients exert granular control over who views their personal health information. 
      While this method of building ethics in from the start of the design process has 
      significant benefits, questions remain about how useful the application of bioethics 
      principles can be in this process, especially when principles conflict. For 
      instance, while the ethical principle of respect for autonomy supports a robust 
      system of granular control, the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence counsel 
      restraint due to the danger of patients being harmed by restrictions on provider 
      access to data. Conflict between principles has long been recognized by ethicists 
      and has even motivated attacks on approaches that state and apply principles. In 
      this paper, we show how using ethical principles can help in the design of EHRs by 
      first explaining how ethical principles can and should be used generally, and then 
      by discussing how attention to details in specific cases can show that the tension 
      between principles is not as bad as it initially appeared. We conclude by suggesting 
      ways in which the application of these (and other) principles can add value to the 
      ongoing discussion of patient involvement in their health care. This is a new 
      approach to linking principles to informatics design that we expect will stimulate 
      further interest.

TI  - Designing a patient-centered user interface for access decisions about EHR data: 
      implications from patient interviews.
PG  - S7-16
LID - 10.1007/s11606-014-3049-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records change the landscape of patient data sharing 
      and privacy by increasing the amount of information collected and stored and the 
      number of potential recipients. Patients desire granular control over who receives 
      what information in their electronic health record (EHR), but there are no current 
      patient interfaces that allow them to record their preferences for EHR access. 
      OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to derive the user needs of patients regarding the design of 
      a user interface that records patients' individual choices about who can access data 
      in their EHRs. DESIGN: We used semi-structured interviews. SETTING: The study was 
      conducted in Central Indiana. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty patients with data stored in an 
      EHR, the majority of whom (70 %) had highly sensitive health EHR data, were included 
      in the study. APPROACH: We conducted a thematic and quantitative analysis of 
      transcribed interview data. KEY RESULTS: Patients rarely knew what data were in 
      their EHRs, but would have liked to know. They also wanted to be able to control who 
      could access what information in their EHR and wanted to be notified when their data 
      we re accessed. CONCLUSIONS: We derived six implications for the design of a 
      patient-centered tool to allow individual choice in the disclosure of EHR: easy 
      patient access to their EHRs; an overview of current EHR sharing permissions; 
      granular, hierarchical control over EHR access; EHR access controls based on dates; 
      contextual privacy controls; and notification when their EHRs are accessed.

PG  - 353-9
LID - 10.1097/SIH.0000000000000049 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sociodemographic differences have been observed in the treatment of 
      extremely premature (periviable) neonates, but the source of this variation is not 
      well understood. We assessed the feasibility of using simulation to test the effect 
      of maternal race and insurance status on shared decision making (SDM) in periviable 
      counseling. METHODS: We conducted a 2 × 2 factorial simulation experiment in which 
      obstetricians and neonatologists counseled 2 consecutive standardized patients 
      diagnosed with ruptured membranes at 23 weeks, counterbalancing race (black/white) 
      and insurance status using random permutation. We assessed verisimilitude of the 
      simulation in semistructured debriefing interviews. We coded physician communication 
      related to resuscitation, mode of delivery, and steroid decisions using a 9-point 
      SDM coding framework and then compared communication scores by standardized patient 
      race and insurer using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Sixteen obstetricians and 15 
      neonatologists participated; 71% were women, 84% were married, and 75% were parents; 
      91% of the physicians rated the simulation as highly realistic. Overall, SDM scores 
      were relatively high, with means ranging from 6.4 to 7.9 (of 9). There was a 
      statistically significant interaction between race and insurer for SDM related to 
      steroid use and mode of delivery (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). 
      Between-group comparison revealed nonsignificant differences (P = <0.10) between the 
      SDM scores for privately insured black patients versus privately insured white 
      patients, Medicaid-insured white patients versus Medicaid-insured black patients, 
      and privately insured black patients versus Medicaid-insured black patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that simulation is a feasible method for studying 
      sociodemographic effects on periviable counseling. Shared decision making may occur 
      differentially based on patients' sociodemographic characteristics and deserves 
      further study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) are central 
      to HIV management. The objective of this study was to compare multiple measures of 
      adherence and investigate factors associated with adherence among HIV-infected 
      children in western Kenya. METHODS: We evaluated ART adherence prospectively for six 
      months among HIV-infected children aged ≤14 years attending a large outpatient HIV 
      clinic in Kenya. Adherence was reported using caregiver report, plasma drug 
      concentrations and Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS®). Kappa statistics 
      were used to compare adherence estimates with MEMS®. Logistic regression analyses 
      were performed to assess the association between child, caregiver and household 
      characteristics with dichotomized adherence (MEMS® adherence ≥90% vs. <90%) and 
      MEMS® treatment interruptions of ≥48 hours. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
      intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Among 191 children, mean age at 
      baseline was 8.2 years and 55% were female. Median adherence by MEMS® was 96.3% and 
      improved over the course of follow-up (p<0.01), although 49.5% of children had at 
      least one MEMS® treatment interruption of ≥48 hours. Adherence estimates were 
      highest by caregiver report, and there was poor agreement between MEMS® and other 
      adherence measures (Kappa statistics 0.04-0.37). In multivariable logistic 
      regression, only caregiver-reported missed doses in the past 30 days (OR 1.25, 95% 
      CI 1.14-1.39), late doses in the past seven days (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.22) and 
      caregiver-reported problems with getting the child to take ART (OR 1.10, 95% CI 
      1.01-1.20) were significantly associated with dichotomized MEMS® adherence. The 
      caregivers reporting that ART made the child sick (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25) and 
      reporting difficulties in the community that made giving ART more difficult (e.g. 
      stigma) (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.27) were significantly associated with MEMS® 
      treatment interruptions in multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Non-adherence in the form of missed and late doses, treatment interruptions of more 
      than 48 hours and sub-therapeutic drug levels were common in this cohort. Adherence 
      varied significantly by adherence measure, suggesting that additional validation of 
      adherence measures is needed. Few factors were consistently associated with 
      non-adherence or treatment interruptions.

TI  - Predictors of medication-related problems among medicaid patients participating in a 
      pharmacist-provided telephonic medication therapy management program.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of medication-related problems (MRPs) among 
      Medicaid patients participating in a telephonic medication therapy management (MTM) 
      program. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data from patients enrolled in a 
      previously published study. DATA SOURCES: Two Medicaid administrative claims file 
      databases (for health care utilization and prescription dispensing information) and 
      one pharmacy organization file for MTM program information. PATIENTS: Seven hundred 
      twelve adult Medicaid patients who participated in a statewide pharmacist-provided 
      telephone-based MTM program and who received an initial medication therapy review. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary dependent variable was the number of MRPs 
      detected during the initial medication therapy review. Secondary dependent variables 
      were the detection of one or more MRPs related to indication, effectiveness, safety, 
      and adherence. Predictor variables were selected a priori that, from the literature 
      and our own practice experiences, were hypothesized as being potentially associated 
      with MRPs: demographics, comorbidities, medication use, and health care utilization. 
      Bivariate analyses were performed, and multivariable models were constructed. All 
      predictor variables with significant associations (defined a priori as p<0.1) with 
      the median number of MRPs detected were then entered into a three-block multiple 
      linear regression model. The overall model was significant (p<0.001, R(2)  = 0.064). 
      Significant predictors of any MRPs (p<0.05) were total number of medications, 
      obesity, dyslipidemia, and one or more emergency department visits in the past 
      3 months. For indication-related MRPs, the model was significant (p<0.001, R(2) 
       = 0.049), and predictors included female sex, obesity, dyslipidemia, and total 
      number of medications (p<0.05). For effectiveness-related MRPs, the model was 
      significant (p<0.001, R(2)  = 0.054), and predictors included bone disease and 
      dyslipidemia (p<0.05). For safety-related MRPs, the model was significant (p<0.001, 
      R(2)  = 0.046), and dyslipidemia was a predictor (p<0.05). No significant predictors 
      of adherence-related MRPs were identified. CONCLUSION: This analysis supports the 
      relative importance of number of medications as a predictor of MRPs in the Medicaid 
      population and identifies other predictors. However, given the models' low R(2) 
      values, these findings indicate that other unknown factors are clearly important and 
      that criteria commonly used for determining MTM eligibility may be inadequate in 
      identifying appropriate patients for MTM in a Medicaid population.

TI  - Primary care physician perceptions of adult survivors of childhood cancer.
PG  - 118-24
LID - 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000061 [doi]
AB  - Increasing cure rates for childhood cancers have resulted in a population of adult 
      childhood cancer survivors (CCS) that are at risk for late effects of 
      cancer-directed therapy. Our objective was to identify facilitators and barriers to 
      primary care physicians (PCPs) providing late effects screening and evaluate 
      information tools PCPs perceive as useful. We analyzed surveys from 351 practicing 
      internal medicine and family practice physicians nationwide. A minority of PCPs 
      perceived that their medical training was adequate to recognize late effects of 
      chemotherapy (27.6%), cancer surgery (36.6%), and radiation therapy (38.1%). Most 
      PCPs (93%) had never used Children's Oncology Group guidelines, but 86% would follow 
      their recommendations. Most (84% to 86%) PCPs stated that they had never received a 
      cancer treatment summary or survivorship care plan but (>90%) thought these 
      documents would be useful. PCPs have a low level of awareness and receive inadequate 
      training to recognize late effects. Overall, PCPs infrequently utilize guidelines, 
      cancer treatment summaries, and survivorship care plans, although they perceive such 
      tools as useful. We have identified gaps to address when providing care for CCS in 
      routine general medical practice.

TI  - Impact of adherence and anthropometric characteristics on nevirapine 
      pharmacokinetics and exposure among HIV-infected Kenyan children.
PG  - 277-86
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000000300 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are insufficient data on pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), particularly for children in low- and middle-income 
      countries. METHODS: We conducted a prospective nevirapine (NVP) PK study among 
      HIV-infected Kenyan children aged 3-13 years initiating an NVP-based ART regimen. 
      NVP dose timing was measured through medication event monitors. Participants 
      underwent 2 inpatient assessments: 1 at 4-8 weeks after ART initiation and 1 at 3-4 
      months after ART initiation. Allometric scaling of oral clearance 
      (CL)/bioavailability (F) and volume of distribution (Vd)/F values were computed. 
      Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling using the first-order conditional estimation with 
      interaction method was performed with covariates. The impact of adherence on time 
      below minimum effective concentration was assessed in the final PK model using 
      medication event monitors data and model-estimated individual parameters. RESULTS: 
      Among 21 children enrolled, mean age was 5.4 years and 57% were female. CL/F was 
      1.67 L/h and Vd/F was 3.8 L for a median child weighing 15 kg. Participants' age had 
      a significant impact on CL/F (P < 0.05), with an estimated decrease in CL of 6.2% 
      for each 1-year increase in age. Total body water percentage was significantly 
      associated with Vd/F (P < 0.001). No children had >10% of time below minimum 
      effective concentration when the PK model assumed perfect adherence compared with 10 
      children when adherence data were used. CONCLUSIONS: Age and body composition were 
      significantly associated with children's NVP PK parameters. ART adherence 
      significantly impacted drug exposure over time, revealing subtherapeutic windows 
      that may lead to viral resistance.

TI  - CD4 trajectory adjusting for dropout among HIV-positive patients receiving 
      combination antiretroviral therapy in an East African HIV care centre.
PG  - 18957
LID - 10.7448/IAS.17.1.18957 [doi]
LID - 18957 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Estimates of CD4 response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) obtained by 
      averaging data from patients in care, overestimate population CD4 response and 
      treatment program effectiveness because they do not consider data from patients who 
      are deceased or not in care. We use mathematical methods to assess and adjust for 
      this bias based on patient characteristics. DESIGN: We examined data from 25,261 
      HIV-positive patients from the East Africa IeDEA Consortium. METHODS: We used 
      inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) to represent patients not in care 
      by patients in care with similar characteristics. We address two questions: What 
      would the median CD4 be "had everyone starting ART remained on observation?" and 
      "were everyone starting ART maintained on treatment?" RESULTS: Routine CD4 count 
      estimates were higher than adjusted estimates even under the best-case scenario of 
      maintaining all patients on treatment. Two years after starting ART, differences 
      between estimates diverged from 30 cells/µL, assuming similar mortality and 
      treatment access among dropouts as patients in care, to over 100 cells/µL assuming 
      20% lower survival and 50% lower treatment access among dropouts. When considering 
      only patients in care, the proportion of patients with CD4 above 350 cells/µL was 
      50% adjusted to below 30% when accounting for patients not in care. One-year 
      mortality diverged 6-14% from the naïve estimates depending on assumptions about 
      access to care among lost patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ignoring mortality and loss to care 
      results in over-estimation of ART response for patients starting treatment and 
      exaggerates the efficacy of treatment programs administering it.

TI  - Psychometric evaluation of the patient satisfaction with logistical aspects of 
      navigation (PSN-L) scale using item response theory.
PG  - 354-61
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0000000000000089 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient navigation--the provision of logistical, educational, and 
      emotional support needed to help patients "navigate around" barriers to high-quality 
      cancer treatment offers promise. No patient-reported outcome measures currently 
      exist that assess patient navigation from the patient's perspective. We use a 
      partial independence item response theory model to report on the psychometric 
      properties of the Patient Satisfaction with Navigation, Logistical measure developed 
      for this purpose. METHODS: We used data from an ethnically diverse sample (n = 1873) 
      from the National Cancer Institute Patient Navigation Research Program. We included 
      individuals with the presence of an abnormal breast, cervical, colorectal, or 
      prostate cancer finding. RESULTS: The partial independence item response theory 
      model fit well. Results indicated that scores derived from responses provide 
      extremely precise and reliable measurement between -2.5 SD below and 2 SD above the 
      mean and acceptably precise and reliable measurement across nearly the entire range. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence in support of the Patient Satisfaction 
      with Navigation, Logistical. Scale users should utilize 1 of the 2 described methods 
      to create scores.

TI  - Barriers to mental health service use and preferences for addressing emotional 
      concerns among lung cancer patients.
PG  - 812-9
LID - 10.1002/pon.3488 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined barriers to mental health service use and preferences 
      for addressing emotional concerns among lung cancer patients (N=165) at two medical 
      centers in the Midwestern United States. METHODS: Lung cancer patients completed an 
      assessment of anxiety and depressive symptoms, mental health service use, barriers 
      to using these services, and preferences for addressing emotional concerns. RESULTS: 
      Only 45% of distressed patients received mental health care since their lung cancer 
      diagnosis. The most prevalent patient-reported barriers to mental health service use 
      among non-users of these services (n=110) included the desire to independently 
      manage emotional concerns (58%) and inadequate knowledge of services (19%). In 
      addition, 57% of distressed patients who did not access mental health services did 
      not perceive the need for help. Seventy-five percent of respondents (123/164) 
      preferred to talk to a primary care physician if they were to have an emotional 
      concern. Preferences for counseling, psychiatric medication, peer support, spiritual 
      care, or independently managing emotional concerns also were endorsed by many 
      patients (range=40-50%). Older age was associated with a lower likelihood of 
      preferring to see a counselor. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that many distressed 
      lung cancer patients underuse mental health services and do not perceive the need 
      for such services. Efforts to increase appropriate use of services should address 
      patients' desire for autonomy and lack of awareness of services.

TI  - Predictors of stage of adoption for colorectal cancer screening among African 
      American primary care patients.
PG  - 241-51
LID - 10.1097/NCC.0b013e3182a40d8d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with other racial groups, African Americans have the highest 
      colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates coupled with lower screening 
      rates. OBJECTIVE: Our study examined the predictors of stage of adoption for fecal 
      occult blood testing (FOBT) and colonoscopy among African American primary care 
      patients who were nonadherent to published screening guidelines. METHODS: Baseline 
      data (N = 815) in a randomized clinical trial were analyzed. Participants were 
      categorized into precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation stages for FOBT 
      and colonoscopy. Predictor variables were demographics, clinical variables, CRC 
      health beliefs and knowledge, and social support. Hierarchical modeling was to 
      identify significant predictors of stage of adoption. RESULTS: Older, male, Veterans 
      Affairs participants and those with higher perceived self-efficacy, family/friend 
      encouragement, and a provider recommendation had higher odds of being at a more 
      advanced stage of adoption for FOBT. Patients with a history of cancer and higher 
      perceived barriers had higher odds of being at an earlier stage of adoption for 
      FOBT. Predictors of more advanced stage of adoption for colonoscopy included higher 
      perceived benefits, higher perceived self-efficacy, family/friend encouragement, and 
      a provider recommendation for colonoscopy. Higher income (>30 000 vs <15 000) was 
      predictive of earlier stage of adoption for colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing 
      self-efficacy, encouragement from family and friends, and provider recommendations 
      are important components of interventions to promote CRC screening. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: Nurses can use knowledge of the characteristics associated with stage of 
      adoption to educate and motivate their African American primary care patients to 
      complete CRC screening tests.

AB  - Reaching Out and Preventing Increases in Diabetes (RAPID) is a community-based 
      randomized trial evaluating the comparative costs and effectiveness of a group-based 
      adaption of the DPP lifestyle intervention developed and implemented in partnership 
      with the YMCA. RAPID enrolled adult primary care patients, with BMI 24 kg/m(2) or 
      higher and abnormal glucose metabolism (HbA1c 5.7-6.9% or fasting plasma glucose 
      100-125 mg/dL). 509 participants were enrolled and randomized to one of two groups: 
      standard clinical advice plus free-of-charge access to a group-based adaption of the 
      DPP offered by the Y, versus standard clinical advice alone. Key outcomes for future 
      analysis will include differences in body weight and other cardiovascular risk 
      factors over a 24-month intervention period. At baseline, RAPID participants had a 
      mean (SD) age of 51 ± 12.1 years, weight of 225.1 ± 56.2 lbs, and BMI of 36.9 ± 8.6 
      kg/m(2). 70.7% were women, 57.2% were African American, 35.4% were non-Hispanic 
      White, and 3.2% were Hispanic. Mean HbA1c was 6.05 ± 0.34%. Additionally, 55.4% of 
      participants had a baseline systolic blood pressure of ≥130 mmHg, 33.1% had a total 
      blood cholesterol exceeding 200mg/dL, and 74% reported a household income of 
      <$25,000. The RAPID Study successfully randomized a large cohort of participants 
      with a wide distribution of age, body weight, and race who are at high risk for 
      developing type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Giving patients granular control of personal health information: using an ethics 
      'Points to Consider' to inform informatics system designers.

LID - S1386-5056(13)00189-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2013.08.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are benefits and risks of giving patients more granular control of 
      their personal health information in electronic health record (EHR) systems. When 
      designing EHR systems and policies, informaticists and system developers must 
      balance these benefits and risks. Ethical considerations should be an explicit part 
      of this balancing. Our objective was to develop a structured ethics framework to 
      accomplish this. METHODS: We reviewed existing literature on the ethical and policy 
      issues, developed an ethics framework called a "Points to Consider" (P2C) document, 
      and convened a national expert panel to review and critique the P2C. RESULTS: We 
      developed the P2C to aid informaticists designing an advanced query tool for an 
      electronic health record (EHR) system in Indianapolis. The P2C consists of six 
      questions ("Points") that frame important ethical issues, apply accepted principles 
      of bioethics and Fair Information Practices, comment on how questions might be 
      answered, and address implications for patient care. DISCUSSION: The P2C is intended 
      to clarify what is at stake when designers try to accommodate potentially competing 
      ethical commitments and logistical realities. The P2C was developed to guide 
      informaticists who were designing a query tool in an existing EHR that would permit 
      patient granular control. While consideration of ethical issues is coming to the 
      forefront of medical informatics design and development practices, more reflection 
      is needed to facilitate optimal collaboration between designers and ethicists. This 
      report contributes to that discussion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the current study, the effects of training maltreating parents and 
      their preschool-aged children in elaborative and emotion-rich reminiscing were 
      examined. METHOD: 44 Parent-child dyads were randomly assigned to a training 
      (reminiscing) or wait-list (control) condition. All participating parents had 
      substantiated maltreatment and were involved with the Department of Child Services 
      at the time of enrollment. Children were 3-6 years old (M = 4.88, SD = .99) and 
      living in the custody of the participating parent. Dyads in the reminiscing 
      condition received four, weekly, in-home sessions in elaborative and emotion rich 
      reminiscing. RESULTS: At a follow-up assessment, maltreating parents in the 
      reminiscing condition provided more high-elaborative utterances, references to 
      children's negative emotions, and explanations of children's emotion during 
      reminiscing than did parents in the control condition. Children in the reminiscing 
      condition had richer memory recall and made more emotion references than did 
      children in the control condition during reminiscing with their mothers, but not 
      with an experimenter. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that maltreating parents can 
      be taught elaborative and emotion-rich reminiscing skills, with benefits for child 
      cognitive and emotional development. The potential clinical utility of a 
      reminiscing-based training for maltreating families with young children is 
      discussed.

TI  - Support service use and interest in support services among distressed family 
      caregivers of lung cancer patients.
PG  - 1549-56
LID - 10.1002/pon.3168 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined support service use and interest in support services 
      among distressed family caregivers of patients recently entering comprehensive 
      cancer care facilities. METHODS: Primary family caregivers of lung cancer patients 
      (N=83) were recruited from three medical centers within 12 weeks of the patient's 
      new visit to the oncology clinic. All family caregivers were screened for 
      psychological distress, and those reporting significant anxiety or depressive 
      symptoms were eligible for this study. Caregivers completed a baseline assessment of 
      support service use (i.e., use of mental health services and complementary and 
      alternative medicine [CAM]) and interest in support services. Support service use 
      was also assessed 3 months later. RESULTS: Although all caregivers reported 
      clinically meaningful distress, only 26% used mental health and 39% used CAM 
      services during the 3-month study period. Patients' receipt of chemotherapy was 
      positively associated with caregivers' mental health service use, whereas greater 
      education and receiving assistance with caregiving tasks were associated with CAM 
      use. Forty percent of caregivers who did not use CAM at baseline were interested in 
      CAM. In addition, 29% of caregivers who did not receive mental health services at 
      baseline were interested in professional psychosocial support, and 29% of caregivers 
      who did not receive staff assistance with practical needs at baseline were 
      interested in this service. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that distressed family 
      caregivers of lung cancer patients underuse mental health services and that a 
      sizable minority are interested in professional help with psychosocial and practical 
      needs.

TI  - Hepatitis C Virus Screening : Factors Associated With Test Completion in a Large 
      Academic Health Care System.
PG  - 333549211054085
LID - 10.1177/00333549211054085 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In 2012, onetime hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening was recommended for 
      all baby boomers (people born during 1945-1965) in the United States, but only 
      4.0%-12.9% of baby boomers have ever had a screening ordered by a health care 
      provider. This study examined the HCV screening prevalence among adult patients in a 
      large academic health care system and assessed factors associated with the 
      completion of screening when ordered for baby boomers. METHODS: We defined HCV 
      screening completion as the completion of an HCV antibody test when it was ordered. 
      We used electronic health records to examine HCV screening completion rates among 
      adults (N = 106 630) from August 1, 2015, through July 31, 2020, by birth cohort. 
      Among baby boomers whose health care provider ordered HCV screening, we examined 
      frequency and percentages of HCV screening completion by sociodemographic and 
      clinical characteristics. We conducted univariate and multivariable logistic 
      regression analyses to assess factors associated with HCV screening completion among 
      baby boomers. RESULTS: During the study period, 73.0% of baby boomers completed HCV 
      screening when it was ordered. HCV completion did not differ by sex or race and 
      ethnicity among baby boomers. Baby boomers with Medicare supplemental health 
      insurance compared with commercial health insurance (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 
      1.87) and those seeing only advanced practice professionals compared with specialty 
      care physicians (aOR = 2.24) were more likely to complete HCV screening when it was 
      ordered. CONCLUSIONS: Noncompletion of HCV screening is one of many barriers along 
      the HCV treatment continuum. Our findings suggest a need for interventions targeting 
      systems, health care providers, and patients to increase HCV screening rates in the 
      United States.

TI  - Psychological distance reduces the effect of internalized stigma on mental health 
      treatment decisions.
PG  - 489-498
LID - 10.1111/jasp.12676 [doi]
AB  - Although stigma is a major barrier to treatment for those with mental health 
      concerns, it is poorly understood when stigma is more or less influential in mental 
      health treatment decisions. In the current work, we examined whether psychological 
      distance - the removal of an event from direct experience - reduced the influence of 
      internalized stigma on willingness to seek treatment. Specifically, we tested the 
      hypothesis that psychological distance versus proximity (e.g., seeking treatment in 
      three months vs. in two days, respectively) decreases the negative influence of 
      stigma on willingness to seek treatment. We focused on a population for whom mental 
      health treatment decisions are personally-relevant: individuals who had previously 
      sought mental health treatment. Experiment 1 showed that the extent to which these 
      individuals internalized (i.e., personally endorsed) stigma about mental illness 
      predicted lower intentions to make an appointment with a mental health care provider 
      for themselves (but not another person). Experiment 2 replicated this result using a 
      different measure of psychological distance (temporal distance) and extended this 
      finding to behavior (time spent reading mental health resources). Overall, this 
      research demonstrated that internalized stigma disrupts mental health 
      treatment-seeking intentions and behaviors when they are psychologically proximal, 
      but not when they are distant. Potential applications of these results are 
      discussed.

TI  - Medication Therapy Management Delivery by Community Pharmacists: Insights from a 
      National Sample of Medicare Part D Beneficiaries.
PG  - 373-382
LID - 10.1002/jac5.1160 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Medicare Part D medication therapy management (MTM) program 
      positions pharmacists to optimize beneficiaries' medications and improve care. 
      Little is known regarding Part D MTM delivery by community pharmacists and other 
      pharmacist provider types. OBJECTIVES: To (1) characterize Medicare Part D MTM 
      delivery by community pharmacists, (2) compare MTM delivery by community pharmacists 
      to other pharmacists, and (3) generate hypotheses for future research. METHODS: A 
      descriptive cross-sectional study using merged data from a 20% random sample of 
      Medicare beneficiary enrollment data with a 100% sample of recently available 2014 
      Part D MTM files was conducted. Andersen's Behavioral Model was applied to describe 
      MTM delivery across beneficiary characteristics. Descriptive and bivariate 
      statistics were used to compare delivery of MTM between community and other 
      pharmacist providers. RESULTS: Among beneficiaries sampled, community pharmacists 
      provided comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) to 22% (n=26,337) of beneficiaries 
      receiving at least one CMR. Almost half (49.4%) were provided face-to-face. Across 
      pharmacist cohorts, median days to CMR offer of post-MTM program enrollment were 
      within the 60-day policy requirement. The community pharmacist cohort had fewer days 
      from CMR offer to receipt (median 47 days). Community pharmacists provided more 
      medication therapy problem (MTP) recommendations (mean [SD] of 1.8 [3.5]; p<0.001), 
      but resolved less MTPs (0.2 [0.7]; p<0.001), and most commonly served beneficiaries 
      that were in the south but less in the west/northeast. Additionally, community 
      pharmacists served a smaller proportion of black beneficiaries, yet a larger 
      proportion of Hispanic beneficiaries (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Community pharmacists 
      provided approximately one in five CMRs for MTM eligible beneficiaries in 2014, with 
      CMRs occurring more quickly, resulting in more MTP recommendations, but resolving 
      less MTPs than those provided by non-community pharmacists. Future research should 
      explore geographic/racial-ethnic disparities in beneficiaries served and strategies 
      to increase negligible MTP resolution by community pharmacists.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial to evaluate locally sourced two-component compression 
      bandages for HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma leg lymphedema in western Kenya: The 
      Kenyan Improvised Compression for Kaposi Sarcoma (KICKS) study protocol.
PG  - 116-122
LID - 10.1016/j.conctc.2018.10.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS), among the most frequent cancers seen 
      in sub-Saharan Africa, is associated with a high prevalence of lymphedema. 
      Lymphedema causes progressive functional impairment marked by swelling, physical 
      discomfort, disfiguring changes, skin hardening from fibrosis, poor wound healing, 
      and recurrent skin infection. While compression therapy is considered a major 
      component of lymphedema management, this intervention has never been evaluated in 
      HIV-associated KS lymphedema. METHODS/DESIGN: The Kenyan Improvised Compression for 
      Kaposi Sarcoma (KICKS) study is a randomized, controlled trial. Due to variable 
      lymphedema stage, we will use block randomization with a 1:1 allocation to assign 
      participants to one of two groups: "Immediate compression" or "Delayed compression." 
      Those randomized to "Immediate compression" intervention arm will receive weekly 
      two-component compression bandages while receiving chemotherapy, whereas those in 
      the "Delayed compression" control arm will be followed during chemotherapy and then 
      receive compression after chemotherapy is completed. The primary outcome is change 
      in Lower Extremity Lymphedema Index from enrollment at Week 0 to blinded outcome 
      assessment at Week 14 between intervention and control arms. Secondary outcomes are 
      change in leg lymphedema-specific quality of life (LYMQOL) and change in overall 
      health quality of life in cancer (EORTC QLQ C30). DISCUSSION: This represents the 
      first study in sub-Saharan Africa to assess a lymphedema-directed intervention for 
      KS, and the intervention-locally sourced two-component compression bandages-is 
      affordable and available. Thus, the KICKS study is an important step towards 
      developing an evidence-based path for regionally relevant management of 
      HIV-associated KS lymphedema. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at 
      ClinicalTrials.gov on January 19, 2018: identifier NCT03404297.

TI  - Development of Low-Cost Locally Sourced Two-Component Compression Bandages in 
      Western Kenya.
PG  - 475-481
LID - 10.1007/s13555-018-0248-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Compression therapy is well-established standard of care for chronic 
      leg ulcers from venous disease and lymphedema. Chronic leg ulcers and lymphedema 
      have a significant impact on quality of life, driven by pain, foul odor, and 
      restricted mobility. Provision of layered compression therapy in resource-limited 
      settings, as in Western Kenya and other regions of sub-Saharan Africa, is a major 
      challenge due to several barriers: availability, affordability, and access to 
      healthcare facilities. When wound care providers from an Academic Model Providing 
      Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) health center in Western Kenya noted that a donated, 
      finite supply of two-component compression bandages was helping to heal chronic leg 
      ulcers, they began to explore the potential of finding a local, sustainable 
      solution. Dermatology and pharmacy teams from AMPATH collaborated with health center 
      providers to address this need. METHODS: Following a literature review and 
      examination of ingredients in prepackaged brand-name kits, essential components were 
      identified: elastic crepe, gauze, and zinc oxide paste. All of these materials are 
      locally available and routinely used for wound care. Two-component compression 
      bandages were made by applying zinc oxide to dry gauze for the inner layer and using 
      elastic crepe as the outer layer. Feedback from wound clinic providers was utilized 
      to optimize the compression bandages for ease of use. RESULTS: Adjustments to 
      assembly of the paste bandage included use of zinc oxide paste instead of zinc oxide 
      ointment for easier gauze impregnation and cutting the inner layer gauze in half 
      lengthwise to facilitate easier bandaging of the leg, such that there were two rolls 
      of zinc-impregnated gauze each measuring 5 inches × 2 m. Adjustments to use of the 
      compression bandage have included increasing the frequency of bandage changes from 7 
      to 3 days during the rainy seasons, when it is difficult to keep the bandage dry. 
      Continuous local acquisition of all components led to lower price quotes for bulk 
      materials, driving down the production cost and enabling a cost to the patient of 
      200 KSh (2 USD) per two-component compression bandage kit. Wound care providers have 
      provided anecdotal reports of healed chronic leg ulcers (from venous stasis, 
      trauma), improved lymphedema, and patient tolerance of compression. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Low-cost locally sourced two-component compression bandages have been developed for 
      use in Western Kenya. Their use has been initiated at an AMPATH health center and is 
      poised to meet the need for affordable compression therapy options in Western Kenya. 
      Studies evaluating their efficacy in chronic leg ulcers and Kaposi sarcoma 
      lymphedema are ongoing. Future work should address adaptation of compression 
      bandages for optimal use in Western Kenya and evaluate reproducibility of these 
      bandages in similar settings, as well as consider home- or community-based care 
      delivery models to mitigate transportation costs associated with accessing 
      healthcare facilities.

TI  - Qualitative study of healthcare providers' current practice patterns and barriers to 
      successful rehydration for pediatric diarrheal illnesses in Kenya.
PG  - e3829
LID - 10.7717/peerj.3829 [doi]
LID - e3829
AB  - BACKGROUND: For children worldwide, diarrhea is the second leading cause of death. 
      These deaths are preventable by fluid resuscitation. Nasogastric tubes (NGs) have 
      been shown to be equivalent to intravenous fluids for rehydration and recommended by 
      the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in severe dehydration. Despite this, NGs 
      are rarely used for rehydration in Kenya. Our objective was to evaluate clinicians' 
      adherence to rehydration guidelines and to identify barriers to the use of NGs for 
      resuscitating dehydrated children. METHODS: A case-based structured survey was 
      administered to pediatric care providers in western Kenya to determine their choices 
      for alternative rehydration therapies when oral rehydration and intravenous fluids 
      fail. Providers then participated in a qualitative, semi-structured interview to 
      identify barriers to using nasogastric tubes for rehydration. Analysis included 
      manual, progressive coding of interview transcripts to identify emerging central 
      themes. RESULTS: Of 44 participants, only four (9%) followed WHO guidelines that 
      recommend quickly switching to NG for rehydration in their case responses. 
      Participants identified that placing intravenous lines in dehydrated children is a 
      challenge. However, when discussing NG use, many believed NGs are not effective for 
      rehydration. Other participants' concerns surrounded knowledge and training 
      regarding guidelines as well as not having NGs available. DISCUSSION: Healthcare 
      providers in western Kenya do not report using NGs for rehydration in accordance 
      with WHO guidelines for diarrheal illness with severe dehydration. Barriers to the 
      use of NG tubes were lack of knowledge and availability. Education and 
      implementation of guidelines using NG tubes for rehydration may improve outcomes of 
      children suffering from diarrheal illness with severe dehydration.

TI  - Symptoms of depression among patients attending a diabetes care clinic in rural 
      western Kenya.
PG  - 51-54
LID - 10.1016/j.jcte.2015.02.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa is rising, but its 
      relationship to depression is not well-characterized. This report describes 
      depressive symptom prevalence and associations with adherence and outcomes among 
      patients with diabetes in a rural, resource-constrained setting. METHODS: In the 
      Webuye, Kenya diabetes clinic, we conducted a chart review, analyzing data including 
      medication adherence, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), clinic attendance, and PHQ-2 
      depression screening results. RESULTS: Among 253 patients, 20.9% screened positive 
      for depression. Prevalence in females was higher than in males; 27% vs 15% 
      (p = 0.023). Glycemic control trends were better in those screening negative; at 24 
      months post-enrollment mean HbA1c was 7.5 for those screening negative and 9.5 for 
      those screening positive (p = 0.0025). There was a nonsignificant (p = 0.269) trend 
      toward loss to follow-up among those screening positive. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      suggest that depression is common among people with diabetes in rural western Kenya, 
      which may profoundly impact diabetes control and treatment adherence.

      randomized study.
PG  - 1003-8.e1
LID - 10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.11.042 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure empirically the influence of race and socioeconomic status 
      (SES) on the diagnosis of child abuse and willingness to report to child protection 
      services. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 5000 pediatricians randomly selected from the 
      American Medical Association's Masterfile received 1 of 4 randomly assigned versions 
      of a fictional clinical presentation of a child (black/white + high SES/low SES) 
      that described an unwitnessed event in a mobile 18-month-old child resulting in an 
      oblique femur fracture. Outcome measures included ranking the degree to which the 
      injury was accidental versus abuse and agreement with reporting the injury to child 
      protection services. RESULTS: A total of 2109 of 4423 physicians responded (47.7%). 
      Patient's race did not have an effect on a diagnosis of abuse (black, 45% versus 
      white, 46%). Abuse was more likely to be diagnosed in patients with low SES (48% 
      versus 43%, overall P = .02). CONCLUSION: This study supports earlier work 
      demonstrating physicians' greater willingness to consider abuse as a potential cause 
      of injury in low SES children. It failed to demonstrate the finding of 
      retrospective, real world studies of an increased likelihood to consider abuse in 
      black patients. Future work should try to understand why there remains a 
      differential approach to evaluating minority children for abuse in real world 
      settings.
